<h2 class="nobreak">Introduction</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Four</span> sturdy young members of the Continental
Army are the chief characters in this
story. Ben Cooper and Nat Brewster were
from Pennsylvania. Ezra Prentiss and his
twin brother George were from Massachusetts.
&#8220;The Young Continentals at Lexington,&#8221; the
first book of the series, was chiefly concerned
with the adventures of Nat Brewster, although
all of the four had a part in the stirring events
in and around Boston at the beginning of the
struggle for the independence of the American
Colonies. They were all employed as couriers
attached to headquarters, and carried messages
for Warren and Putnam, and later for
the great general-in-chief, Washington. The
second story, &#8220;The Young Continentals at
Bunker Hill,&#8221; told of the part played by Ezra
Prentiss, assisted by his friends, and the third
story, &#8220;The Young Continentals at Trenton,&#8221;
described some of the good services rendered
by George Prentiss. This book tells the story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
of Ben Cooper at Princeton and in the dark
period of Brandywine and Valley Forge, and
ends with the victory at Monmouth, when
Washington overcame not only his open
enemies, but &#8220;they of his own household.&#8221;</p>

<p>All four books are true pictures of the days
when even boys showed that they could be
good patriots, and set an example of loyal,
modest, faithful service that thousands of
American boys are still glad to follow.</p>

<small>TELLS HOW MR. TOBIAS HAWKINS MADE THE<br />
ACQUAINTANCE OF MR. SAMUEL LIVINGSTONE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Do</span> you know what to-morrow will be,
Ben Cooper?&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker was a dwarfish looking lad
whose big head and upstanding crest of hair
gave him a most curious appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; replied the second boy,
promptly, &#8220;will be New Year&#8217;s day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dwarf shifted his leather belt so that
his huge service pistol might hang more comfortably;
and his voice, when he spoke again,
contained a note of complaint.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be that, to be sure; but it will also
be just one week since Washington crossed
the Delaware and beat the Hessians.&#8221;</p>

<p>The eyes of the other boy sparkled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>&#8220;Ah, that was the night,&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;There, indeed, was sport, excitement and
glory.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dwarf shook his large head.</p>

<p>&#8220;For you and for Nat and the others,&#8221; protested
he. &#8220;But not for me. While you
were all having your fill of fighting, I was
away in Philadelphia, riding here and there,
at the beck and call of a parcel of excited
committeemen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben Cooper&#8217;s good-natured face was all
a-wrinkle with smiles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Porcupine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The
war is not over as yet, by a good deal. They
say Cornwallis is on his way across the Jerseys,
and as he&#8217;s the best fighter the British have,
we may expect plenty of warm work still.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon; the pale wintry
sun was dipping slowly toward the cluster
of peaked roofs which marked the location of
Philadelphia; the snow-packed road with its
topping of ice went stretching ahead like a
gleaming serpent.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will reach there before sundown,&#8221;
said Ben, his eye upon the housetops as
though marking the sun&#8217;s position. &#8220;And I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
trust that we find Mr. Morris at home, for I
fancy that the general&#8217;s dispatches are somewhat
urgent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The general&#8217;s dispatches to Mr. Robert
Morris are always urgent,&#8221; said the Porcupine.
&#8220;I have carried more than one of them, and
I know. And I have carried them for other
officers and gentlemen in and out of the
army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Merchant Morris seems a most important
person,&#8221; smiled Ben.</p>

<p>The Porcupine brushed his crest of hair
more stiffly erect than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it any wonder that he is?&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know much about the ways of people
of quality, but I do know that without Master
Morris there would be little money with
which to feed and pay the troops.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is very rich, I hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard so too. And then, again, I
have heard that he has not much more than
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said he, &#8220;he has the power to raise
funds. He seems to know by instinct the
way to hidden hordes. And somehow, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
knows the magic word which causes the
hoarders to unlock the treasure chests. Congress,
I think, has much to thank Merchant
Morris for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben touched his horse with the spur, and it
responded instantly. It was a clean built
animal whose small head and slim, powerful
legs indicated Arab blood. The Porcupine&#8217;s
mount was a tall, raw-boned beast, sway-backed
and with a wicked eye; but it evidently
had bottom, for with a long, awkward
stride it easily kept him at the side of his
friend.</p>

<p>As they entered the suburbs, the drifted
road gave way to the clearer streets; and when
they entered the city proper, they found
Second Street bare of snow, but with stones
ice-coated and glistening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Front Street will not be so bad,&#8221; spoke
Ben; &#8220;there is never so much traffic there,
and the snow will still be untrodden.&#8221;</p>

<p>They turned Sassafras Street and into
Front; and when nearing Arch they caught
the gleam of arms and uniforms, and saw
the townspeople scurrying along as though
attracted by something unusual. When they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
reached the market-place at the foot of
High Street, the two boys saw the reason for
this. Along Front Street was drawn a force
of Continental troops, and under their watchful
eyes was a rabble of unshaven, tattered,
dispirited looking men to the number of
several thousands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; spoke the Porcupine, surprisedly,
as he looked over the heads of the crowd from
the back of his tall steed; &#8220;and who are
these?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our friends, the Hessians, captured at
Trenton,&#8221; replied Ben Cooper. &#8220;I heard that
the greater part of them were being sent westward
to Lancaster or York for safe keeping.
And they seem to have just reached Philadelphia.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ragged wretches stood in long lines,
gazing stupidly at their captors and at the
curious throngs. And that these could be the
mercenaries who had spread terror through
the Jerseys seemed impossible.</p>

<p>A perky looking little man, standing upon
tiptoe to get a glimpse of the captives, exclaimed
in a high-pitched, astonished voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;And are these really the hirelings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
whom we have heard so much! Why, they
look like common vagabonds.&#8221;</p>

<p>A plethoric gentleman in a huge waistcoat
and steel buckles seemed to grow even more
expansive with indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The idea,&#8221; he panted. &#8220;The bare idea of
such vermin spreading fear through an entire
state. And the idea of our statesmen and our
generals and our soldiers permitting it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The perky man nodded and settled back
upon his heels.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you say, sir, is proper and correct,&#8221;
agreed he. &#8220;I am quite amazed that such a
condition of affairs has been permitted to continue
for so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A lot of scurvy ruffians,&#8221; stated the
plethoric gentleman, wrathfully. &#8220;A gathering
of mean, low fellows without a shred of
ambition, or the slightest appearance of manly
bearing. You do well, sir,&#8221; to the perky
gentleman, &#8220;to be amazed. No such thing
would have been permitted in any other
nation under the sun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben glanced at the Porcupine, and his good-humoured
eyes were filled with laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is easy to see,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that neither of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
our friends here has been where the Hessians
ranged with their muskets in their hands.
These,&#8221; and he nodded toward the wretched
array of foreigners, &#8220;do present an uncommonly
ill-favored appearance; but properly
uniformed, officered and armed, they were as
formidable troops as were in all of Howe&#8217;s
army.&#8221;</p>

<p>Close at the elbow of the plethoric gentleman
stood a tall man with prominent features
and great square shoulders. He was richly
dressed and carried himself with the air of a
person of consequence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said he to the stout man, &#8220;what you
have just said I agree with as heartily as our
friend here,&#8221; bowing to the perky man. &#8220;It
is a shame and a scandal that our army should
have allowed these wretched Dutchmen to
hold them so long in check. To be sure,&#8221; and
he gestured with one hand in a scornful
fashion, &#8220;they have been beaten and taken.
But it should have happened long ago. It
should have been done promptly and out of
hand. It would seem to me,&#8221; confidentially,
&#8220;that our military leaders are not all that
they should be.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;you have expressed
my sentiments precisely. I could not have
spoken them in more fitting terms. Our
officers are not what they should be. They
are far from it, as they have proven a
dozen times, since the fighting began at New
York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Congress is at fault,&#8221; spoke the perky man.
&#8220;They should see to it that we are provided
with competent gentlemen to conduct our
military enterprises.&#8221;</p>

<p>The plethoric gentleman seemed to agree
with this statement unqualifiedly. But the
tall man shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Congress,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is a much harassed
body. It has a great deal to do, and no great
amount of experience to guide it. But for
the greater part it does very well indeed.
There are gentlemen belonging to it,&#8221; with
a lowered tone, and a series of knowing
nods, &#8220;who would readily replace a certain
person if they could.&#8221;</p>

<p>The plethoric one contented himself with
puffing his cheeks and assuming a look of
much sagacity. It was the perky man who
spoke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>&#8220;I have heard,&#8221; said he, his head at one
side, like that of an inquisitive bird, &#8220;that
Washington is not greatly in favor with some
of the members of Congress. Of course,&#8221;
and the inquisitive cock of the head grew
more pronounced, &#8220;it is he you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the tall man closed his lips tightly, and
shook his head after the manner of one who
disliked committing himself. It was the stout
man who spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;The naming of names,&#8221; said he, with
heavy wisdom, &#8220;is sometimes to be avoided;
and this is one of the times. Gentlemen can
carry on an intelligent conversation without
placing themselves on record in matters of
delicacy; and in this way important matters
can be kept from becoming things of common
gossip.&#8221;</p>

<p>Properly rebuked, the perky man gave his
attention once more to the captive mercenaries,
while the speaker continued, addressing the
tall man, in a guarded tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a matter of wonderment with me
how people can have so little consideration as
to discuss private matters of state in the hearing
of every Tom, Dick and Harry. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
an almost criminal propensity, believe me,
sir; and I always discountenance it when I
have the opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other nodded, with gravity.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a common failing,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and I
have little doubt but what it has occasioned
more trouble in the public&#8217;s affairs than any
of us have any knowledge of. And I am glad
indeed to meet with a gentleman who is so
careful of the general weal; it is a rare occasion,
sir; more&#8217;s the pity.&#8221;</p>

<p>The large man took out a silver snuff-box,
his great face growing more mottled than
originally; offering the box to the other, he
said in a tone of much gratification:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, I should be exceedingly pleased with
your acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tall man took a pinch of the proffered
snuff; and as he dusted the remaining grains
from his finger-tips, he made reply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, you are very good. My name is
Hawkins&mdash;Tobias Hawkins&mdash;and I am lately
arrived from Savannah, in Georgia, where I
have some shipping enterprises.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you,&#8221; said the plethoric man,
with ponderous politeness. He took a companionable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
pinch, restored the box to one of the
huge pockets of his waistcoat, and went on: &#8220;I
am Samuel Livingstone, merchant and trader
in West India goods. And it gives me much
pleasure, Master Hawkins, to know you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two had fallen into a most earnest
conversation upon the condition of trade and
public affairs when a drum began to tap, and
the long lines of American troops and bedraggled
Germans fell into column; then at the
word of command they went marching away
southward.</p>

<p>As the crowd dispersed, Ben Cooper did not
immediately turn his horse&#8217;s head up High
Street, as the Porcupine evidently expected
him to do; instead, he sat motionless in his
saddle watching the retreating forms of Messrs.
Samuel Livingstone and Tobias Hawkins.
When he did finally give his rein a shake as a
signal to his mount, the curious, speculative
expression upon his face did not lessen. And
as he turned into Second Street once more, he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, that was a rather queer
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Porcupine had noticed his manner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
but had made no comment; now, however, he
asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the conduct of Mr. Tobias Hawkins,
as he called himself. Did you notice him?&#8221;</p>

<p>The dwarf nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;And rather a wide-awake sort, I thought
him,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But I did not see anything
queer in him. Very even, and much like a
gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ben shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean in that respect. He appeared
to be all you say, but at the same time
there was a something&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he paused as
though uncertain for a moment, then went on
with thoughtful face. &#8220;To all appearance his
meeting with Merchant Livingstone was pure
accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Porcupine opened his eyes wide.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; demanded he. &#8220;And was it not
so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; replied Ben. &#8220;Rather, I
am inclined to believe that it was a cunningly
devised plan. I scarcely know what makes
me think so, but Hawkins purposed making
acquaintance of Mr. Livingstone before he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
spoke to him; and so expertly did he contrive
matters that he&#8217;s made it appear that it was
Mr. Livingstone who sought him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it may be so,&#8221; said the dwarf.
&#8220;These traders have very curious ways, I&#8217;ve
heard. But, in any event, it makes no
difference. We are not at all interested in
their doings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said young Cooper, gravely.
&#8220;If the matter which Mr. Hawkins has in
mind is commercial, of course we are not;
but,&#8221; and he turned his head as though to get
a fresh sight of the gentlemen in question, &#8220;if
it is something else, perhaps it may turn out
that we are.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>IN WHICH MR. HAWKINS UTTERS A THREAT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Porcupine was still turning over the
odd remarks of his companion, when they
pulled up at that famous hostelry of Revolutionary
days, &#8220;The City Tavern.&#8221; In the
inn yard, Ben, looking down from his saddle,
inquired of a hostler who had come to take
their mounts:</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you tell me where Mr. Robert Morris
lives?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean the merchant, Morris?&#8221;
asked the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find his house on Chestnut
Street, near to Seventh,&#8221; directed the man.</p>

<p>They dismounted, and saw to it that their
horses would be cleaned, fed and bedded;
after this they went into the tavern and
bespoke lodgings for themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;And will you have supper also, gentlemen?&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
smiled the landlord. &#8220;Piping hot it
will be, the very sort for a damp, chilly evening
like this. Taken in a snug, warm room,
I can conceive of nothing more inviting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben laughed. He and the landlord were
old acquaintances, and the lad knew his
ways.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; spoke Ben, &#8220;if your supper and
your rooms were only half as enticing as your
manner of speaking of them, they would be
the most desired things in all Philadelphia.
However, we will put both of them to the test
in a very little while. I have a message to
deliver, and then we shall try whether or no
you can prove what you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a very short time Ben, having left the
Porcupine behind, arrived at the house of
Robert Morris and sounded the heavy brass
knocker. A thin-shouldered woman in a
white cap came to the door and replied to his
questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Mr. Morris is not at home.
Indeed, he will not be home until late, by all
accounts, for I&#8217;ve heard it said that he&#8217;ll sup
to-night at one of the taverns with some
friends.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>&#8220;My business is important,&#8221; said Ben.
&#8220;Can you tell me at which of the taverns he
will be?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the woman shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am sorry, young gentleman,
but I cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben considered for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you oblige me with a pen full of ink
and a slip of paper?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Thereupon the woman invited him to walk
in; in the wide hall he was provided with the
desired articles, and so wrote a few lines explaining
who he was and the nature of his
errand. The note he gave to the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall return between this and midnight,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Mr. Morris will, no doubt, have
returned by then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, sir,&#8221; replied the woman, earnestly.
&#8220;He will be sure to be home by then. And
I will give him your message as soon as he
comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The evening was a brisk one; the moon was
coming up clearly, the air was tingling with
cold, and the lad&#8217;s spurs jangled upon the
flags as he stepped buoyantly along.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the sort of weather that makes one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
feel like undertaking some enterprise,&#8221; he
told himself, his spirits rising with every step
he took. &#8220;If it is the same in the neighborhood
of Trenton, I should not be surprised to
shortly hear that the general has set out again
upon another venture against the British.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped jauntily into the coffee room of
the tavern; the candles were lighted, the
curtains were drawn at the small paned
windows and a heap of logs crackled in a
huge fireplace. Before this sat the Porcupine
upon a stool, his short legs crossed one upon
another and deeply engaged in a conversation
with&mdash;of all persons in the world&mdash;Mr. Tobias
Hawkins.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawkins stood with one foot upon the
fender, and one elbow upon the mantel; he
looked very stalwart and very handsome as
he gazed laughingly down at the dwarf, and
seemed very much amused at something which
the latter had said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; remarked he, to the high admiration
of some serving maids, and other
attach&eacute;s of the inn, &#8220;you are a patriot, are
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; replied the Porcupine, as cool as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
you please, &#8220;and I try to act up to the way I
think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; cried Mr. Hawkins. &#8220;Excellent,
indeed! A patriot who tries to put
his opinions into acts! Why, this is a
prodigy! If all patriots were of your kidney,
my fine fellow, belike we&#8217;d have more deeds
than words.&#8221; He ran his fingers through his
coarse, luxuriant hair, and his eye challenged
the mirth of a few guests supping at the round
tables. &#8220;But come,&#8221; he added, &#8220;let us hear
what form your actions took.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What other form could they take but
good blows?&#8221; quoth the Porcupine, sagely.
&#8220;What other form would be understood in
these times but hard knocks?&#8221;</p>

<p>The mirth of Hawkins filled the room; the
titters of the servant maids and the grins
of the waiters showed their entertainment;
broad smiles were on the faces of the guests
who had heard the dwarf&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you mean to tell me that you delivered
the good blows you speak of?&#8221; demanded
Hawkins. &#8220;And the hard knocks?
Surely, the foe must have trembled when he
saw you preparing for the fight.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>&#8220;If inches won battles, then the British
would never lose one,&#8221; stated the Porcupine,
calmly. &#8220;Their beef-eaters are each as big as
two men.&#8221; With a comical gesture he hitched
his belt about and brought the huge pistol
which he still carried into plain view. &#8220;The
little fellow can shoot as straight as the big
one,&#8221; he added; &#8220;and, sometimes, better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Tobias Hawkins, and he stared
with interest at the weapon, which he now
apparently noted for the first time. &#8220;I see.&#8221;
There was a pause during which he examined
the dwarf with amused unbelief; then he inquired:
&#8220;And where, may I be permitted to
ask, has the excellence of your aim been called
into play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Lexington,&#8221; replied the Porcupine,
with never a wrinkle of his countenance;
&#8220;also at Bunker Hill; and again in some less
important affairs about the town of Boston.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something about the simplicity
of this answer that drove the smiles from the
faces turned toward the speaker. The unbelieving
amusement in the face of Hawkins,
however, remained.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that you are a person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
who has seen service. Mayhap, you were also
a partaker in the matter at Trenton, a few
weeks ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no such good luck,&#8221; replied the
Porcupine, moodily. &#8220;By all right I should
have been there; but some folks need a great
deal of scurrying to keep them at rest, and so
I must be riding here and there for them, delivering
letters filled with nothing when I
might have been of some real service beyond
the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no laughter or grinning at this;
even Hawkins seemed to have concluded that
he had exhausted the dwarf&#8217;s humorous possibilities,
for he yawned and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well, you take yourself seriously
enough, I&#8217;ll say that for you, my lad. But,
then, it is as well that you do so, for you&#8217;ll
find as you progress through life that others
will not go far out of their way to do the like.&#8221;
And with this the man turned away, calling
to the host: &#8220;Landlord, have not my friends
arrived?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Hawkins, not yet, sir. It is a
trifle early, I think. You said eight o&#8217;clock,
and it is not much after seven.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>Hawkins looked at a huge silver watch and
replaced it in his pocket with a frown. Ben
noticed this with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some,&#8221; thought the lad, &#8220;to have noted
him a few moments ago, would have fancied
him a chap of rare wit and good nature. But
it was only while trying to hold up another
to ridicule. Now that the point of his wit
has been turned, he is ill-tempered enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hawkins paced the floor of the coffee room
impatiently. Ben and the Porcupine ordered
and ate their supper at a table near the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;A beefsteak pie,&#8221; remarked the dwarf, &#8220;is
a dish not to be ill considered. I know of
nothing that affords a hungry stomach more
satisfaction.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben watched the blaze dart up the huge
throat of the chimney; the logs crackled and
the fire roared; the boy stretched his booted
legs out toward it with a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;After a long day on the road,&#8221; said he, &#8220;the
fire is as good as the food. And,&#8221; with a glance
around, &#8220;the room is as satisfying as either.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was some little time since they had sat
down to their meal, and quite a number of
persons had come and gone. So when Ben<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
cast his eyes about it is not at all surprising
that he should notice some of the newcomers.
Suddenly he sat erect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;What now?&#8221; asked the Porcupine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see that one of Mr. Hawkins&#8217; friends has
arrived.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dwarf screwed his head around so that
he might see; and when he had done so he
whistled lowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Merchant Livingstone!&#8221; said he. &#8220;So
they are to sup together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Friend Hawkins does not lag in the matter
of clinching his friendships,&#8221; smiled Ben.
&#8220;Look at him. One would fancy that he&#8217;d
been in touch with the other all his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two mentioned were seated at a table
no great distance away; their heads were bent
close together, and Hawkins was speaking
earnestly and in a rather lowered voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it would not do, as
I already remarked to-day, to speak too
openly upon certain subjects. But they can
be discussed guardedly and with circumspection,
and so do no general harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Mr. Livingstone, eagerly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
&#8220;I understand and thoroughly appreciate
your standpoint. But,&#8221; and his head went
nearer to that of his new friend, &#8220;are there
actually steps being taken to&mdash;to oust, so to
speak&mdash;a certain person?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hawkins waved one large, well-kept hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it is entirely too
early to expect such definite things as &#8216;steps&#8217;
in the matter. At most, it is but under consideration.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I see.&#8221; Mr. Livingstone nodded his
head wisely. &#8220;No steps have been taken,
but the matter is being considered.&#8221; There
was a pause of a few moments, then he added
with a resumption of his former eagerness:
&#8220;Can you tell me, is the thing being well
considered?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hawkins shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is all I can say at this time. The
matter came to me quite in the way of an accident,
and I passed my word as a gentleman
to keep silent regarding it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure, to be sure,&#8221; said Merchant
Livingstone, hastily. &#8220;And quite right, too,
sir. It were best that the utmost privacy be
exercised in such things.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>The speaker sat staring ponderously, straight
before him, his great face solemn and approving.
There was a silence between them
and it was Hawkins who finally broke it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were to have a friend to sup with you,
were you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two of them,&#8221; answered Livingstone.
&#8220;That is why I so strongly urged you to
come. I desired you to meet them, for they
are persons of consequence in Philadelphia&mdash;yes,
and in the nation, too, for the matter of
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hawkins nodded, but said nothing. Ben
watching him, curiously, saw an expectant
look in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; continued Merchant Livingstone,
&#8220;only one of them will attend. But
he is a fine fellow, and I&#8217;m sure you will be
delighted with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; asked Hawkins.</p>

<p>At this moment there was a clatter of
crockery at the far side of the coffee room, one
of the waiters having met with a mishap.
Ben could not catch the name spoken by the
fat merchant, but Hawkins apparently heard
it, for his face lit up suddenly; and for an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
instant the boy felt sure there was exultation
in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said the man, and his tones showed
only mild interest, &#8220;I am quite charmed. I
did not expect to meet so famous a personage
during my stay in your city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have many friends, both in commercial
and public life,&#8221; said the fat merchant, complacently.
&#8220;And before you leave for the
South I shall take much pleasure in presenting
you to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here followed a great deal of talk regarding
Mr. Livingstone&#8217;s friends; Ben, as he idly
listened, noted that now and then the interest
of Hawkins was aroused at the mention of
certain names; but for the most part the man
made no sign.</p>

<p>All this time the Porcupine, who sat with
his back to the two men, had been studying
Ben. And when he noted a flagging of the
latter&#8217;s interest, he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that you have
been mightily taken by those two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben smiled good-humoredly; and yet there
was a grave expression in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;By one of them only,&#8221; he corrected.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>&#8220;And that is Master Hawkins,&#8221; said the
dwarf.</p>

<p>Ben nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221; asked the other, curiously.
&#8220;Have you ever seen him before to-day?
What has he done that you should be so
interested in him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben made no reply for a few moments; and
when he did speak his voice was low and
troubled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know just why I am so interested
in him,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I have never seen him
before to-day; and it is not anything which
he has done which attracts me; it is,&#8221; vaguely,
&#8220;what he may be about to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Porcupine looked astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;What he may be about to do,&#8221; repeated
he. &#8220;Well, now we have a dealing in mysteries,
indeed! And what do you think he
may be about to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ben Cooper shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. It is not definite enough for
me to give it a name. I have a sort of presentiment
that harm is to come through him;
that is all I can make out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dwarf sat in silence, trying to understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
this. He brushed his stiff crest of hair
more erect, wrinkled his brows and stared at
his friend; but, apparently, he could make
nothing of it all. And while he was so engaged
a somewhat stout man, with a round
face and shrewd eyes, came into the coffee
room. It was the landlord who hastened
forward to relieve him of his cloak and three-cornered
hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hah!&#8221; said the round-faced man as he
stamped upon the hearth to warm his feet,
&#8220;it keeps cold, landlord.&#8221; He unwound a
great length of woolen comforter from about
his neck and then rubbed his hands briskly
together before the blaze. &#8220;But then, what
else would we have for a New Year&#8217;s Eve?&#8221;</p>

<p>Seemingly the gentleman was the one whom
Merchant Livingstone expected, for that honest
man greeted him warmly and presented
Hawkins. Again in the whirl of words did
Ben lose the name.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am right glad to meet Master Hawkins,&#8221;
said the newcomer. &#8220;I do not recollect any
one in Savannah of the name with whom my
firm has had dealings; but then,&#8221; with a
laugh, &#8220;I do not profess to recall them all.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>&#8220;We have never had the pleasure of any
transactions with your house, sir,&#8221; said Tobias
Hawkins, smoothly. &#8220;Our trade is mostly
importations from the islands, and gulf points.
Spanish goods, and Portuguese, too, we import
in foreign bottoms, for such are largely demanded
by the ports along the gulf and south
coast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their supper was served to them, and the
three fell to with hearty appetites; but the
meal had not progressed far when Master
Livingstone again fell to talking politics.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot express my gratification,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;at seeing so excellent a patriot as our friend
Hawkins coming from so youthful a province
as Georgia. It shows, it seems to me, that
the spark of patriotism is wide-spread; and
this being the case, it cannot but help gaining
headway as time goes on.&#8221;</p>

<p>The round-faced gentleman nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is my own way of looking
at it. And patriotism alone is what will keep
the war against tyranny moving. It will fill
the ranks of the army, it will provide money
to pay the troops, it will keep competent
commanders in the field.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>Master Livingstone glanced at Tobias
Hawkins, and that gentleman nodded his
head and pursed up his lips. What he
meant by this was an enigma, but to the
mind of the fat merchant, it was simple
enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said that worthy, &#8220;in that last remark
you put your finger upon the vital point of
this struggle, sir. Pure patriotism alone will
supply competent commanders to lead our
troops. But the patriots should be careful.
They should make sure that the commanders
fixed upon are competent.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment there was a silence; then
the round-faced man said:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a tang to your voice, Neighbor
Livingstone, that would lead one to suppose
that you doubt the ability of the army&#8217;s
leaders.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment the other merchant stammered;
his great face became mottled with
agitation; and when he finally found his
tongue, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I have no military skill, and do
not profess to be a judge of these matters.
But there are many who are complaining;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
and there are not a few who openly say that
we should have a change.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other nodded, and settled his napkin
more comfortably under his chin.</p>

<p>&#8220;A change?&#8221; said he. &#8220;Oh, yes, there are
a great many who are crying for that. But
who are they, sir? Answer me.&#8221; He glanced
at the other two as though challenging them
to reply. Livingstone in turn glanced at
Hawkins, and as that gentleman gave no sign,
he, also, remained mute. The speaker tasted
delicately of the dish before him, then pointing
his fork at the silent twain, proceeded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Since you don&#8217;t seem able to answer, I
will do so for you. The thing had its beginning
with a parcel of knaves who thought to
line their pockets out of the public funds;
and later they were joined by disappointed
officers whose preferment had been discountenanced
by General Washington because he
knew them for what they were.&#8221;</p>

<p>Master Livingstone coughed apologetically;
it were as though he disliked controverting
his guest, but felt compelled by facts to do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is, perhaps, some truth in what you
say,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But then, there are many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
persons who belong to neither of the classes
you mention, who believe the present commander-in-chief
to be unfit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other made no reply to this, merely
gesturing his impatience with such people.
His silence seemed to encourage Merchant
Livingstone, who went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, look the thing candidly in the face,
my dear sir, and tell me if you don&#8217;t think
these good folk have some cause for believing
as they do. There is the campaign about
New York. It is notorious that it was sadly
bungled. Long Island would have been won
by any far-seeing officer; the affairs on the
river and above New York would have proven
matters of little effort to many a man who is
held idle here in the city. The flight across
the Jerseys&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But at this the round-faced man lost all patience.
He tore his napkin from about his
neck and dashed it down upon the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;The flight across the Jerseys is precisely
on a footing with all the other things you
have mentioned or can mention. With a
handful of badly armed men, Washington fell
back before a disciplined army; at every halting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
place he sent appeals for help, and though
he was in the most desperate danger, no aid
was given him; though he crossed the entire
state, not a hundred militia answered his call.&#8221;
Here the angry gentleman got upon his feet
and glared at his adversary. &#8220;Did they expect
him to give battle with his bare hands?
A commission is not all that an officer requires, sir.
He cannot wave it in the face of
the enemy and expect them to be seized with
fright. He must be given men, sir&mdash;men and
money; and unless he is given them, what
rational person can expect anything but defeat
and retreat?&#8221;</p>

<p>That Mr. Samuel Livingstone was astounded
at this outburst was evident. He lifted one fat
hand in protest, and said with much emotion:</p>

<p>&#8220;My good friend, don&#8217;t be violent, I beg!
I did not think to offend you, but to merely
repeat some things which could not help but
reach my ear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does not set well upon a man of your
years and station, Livingstone, to repeat common
gossip. What has been said to the discredit
of General Washington has been said
behind his back. Not one of his detractors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
has had the courage to speak openly and specifically&mdash;that
is, not one whom he would
think it worth while to controvert. The
whole matter is a rascally one, sir, and every
worthy person should frown upon it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant to give you no offense,&#8221; said
Master Livingstone.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you have not. What I say is said as
a citizen, my friend; and I have no personal
feeling in the matter whatever.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, when the speaker sat down once
more, Ben Cooper noted that his manner was
not at all as even as it had been formerly.
Apparently he was no lukewarm friend of the
commander-in-chief of the American forces,
and felt the insinuations leveled against that
gentleman much more keenly than he cared
to admit.</p>

<p>Livingstone spoke but little after this; his
friend&#8217;s reception of his views had so abashed
him that he seemed to prefer to keep silent.
But with Hawkins it was different. With
smooth insinuation he entered into the matter
under discussion; he stated no views, but
seemed somewhat eager as to the views of
others. Ben listened with attention; now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
and then he noted the man&#8217;s eye lift in his
direction, but as the glances seemed merely
passing ones he gave them no heed. After a
time the Porcupine spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Master Hawkins seems very inquisitive,&#8221;
remarked he, shrewdly. &#8220;Mark you, how he
asks questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, also, mark you, whom the questions
hinge upon,&#8221; said Ben, with meaning.</p>

<p>Intently the dwarf listened, all the time
seeming much interested in the remnants of
the beefsteak pie. At last he looked up at
Ben, his brows lifted and his mouth drawn to
one side, knowingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wants to know about the people who
are speaking ill of General Washington&mdash;especially
about those officers who think themselves
ill-treated.&#8221; There was a silence, and
as Ben said nothing, the dwarf asked: &#8220;I
wonder why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I, too, wonder why,&#8221; said Ben, and there
was that same speculative look in his face
which the Porcupine had noted more than
once since their first sight of Tobias Hawkins
on the outskirts of the throng which had
watched the captive Hessians.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>After Mr. Livingstone and his guests had
done with their supper, they sat for some time
and talked. Hawkins&#8217; part in this was still
questioning; and always, as the Porcupine had
shrewdly noted, questions concerning those
who bore General Washington ill will. The
clock struck ten as the round-faced man arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not thought it so late. You will
excuse me, Livingstone, and you, Mr. Hawkins,
for leaving you so abruptly. But my
time is much taken up these nights; I have
much correspondence thrust upon me, and
many books to put in order before I sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying he called for his cloak, his comforter
and three-cornered hat; and shaking
hands with his companions he hurried out
into the cold streets. It was no great while
after this before Hawkins and Livingstone
also made up their minds to go; the former
stood before the cheerfully blazing fire as he
drew on his greatcoat and adjusted his hat;
then with his hands upon his hips he turned
and stared Ben straight in the eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust, young sir, that you will have no
difficulty in recognizing me when next we
chance to meet.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>Ben was taken by surprise; but he contrived
to present a cool front and make reply:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a habit of remembering faces, sir.
And yours,&#8221; inspecting the man with much
calmness, &#8220;is one not readily forgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man favored him with a smile which
was not altogether pleasant to see. The good
humor of the early evening was now completely
gone; his strong features were harsh
and hawk-like.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; sneered he, &#8220;you, like our
young friend here, have been to the wars.&#8221;
As the boy made no reply, he went on: &#8220;Perhaps
a person with good sight might have
seen you also at Bunker Hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is possible,&#8221; smiled Ben. &#8220;There were a
great many there.&#8221; He looked steadfastly into
the man&#8217;s face and continued, intending the
saying merely as a jest and that he should not
be thought backward with an answer: &#8220;And
who knows, sir, but that one with even less
excellent vision might have noted you there?&#8221;</p>

<p>The effect of this upon the man was startling.
For an instant he glared like a tiger
and his powerful hands clinched.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>&#8220;Master Hawkins!&#8221; cried Samuel Livingstone,
alarmed.</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s countenance cleared like magic;
with a wide gesture he burst into a great
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind me, sir,&#8221; cautioned he. &#8220;I
will have my jest at even the most unseemly
of times. But come, I&#8217;ll not detain you with
my clowning.&#8221; And with that he took the
merchant by the arm and started jovially for
the door. But upon reaching it he turned
and addressed himself to Ben once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask your pardon, my lad, for the liberty
taken in presuming to have a laugh at your
expense. Perhaps,&#8221; and there was a covert
meaning in both his voice and eyes, &#8220;we shall
meet at some other time. And, if it should
so chance, trust me to remember you, even if
you should, after all, forget me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that the door closed upon both
him and the merchant, and Ben and the Porcupine
sat looking into each other&#8217;s faces.</p>

<small>SHOWS HOW BEN COOPER STARTED UPON<br />
A MISSION IN THE EARLY DAWN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a brief space after the departure of
Tobias Hawkins and Merchant Livingstone,
Ben Cooper and the Porcupine continued to
look inquiringly at each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said the dwarf, at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; returned Ben, in the same tone,
and with that they burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;An odd fish,&#8221; commented the Porcupine,
crossing one short leg over the other and
nodding his head. &#8220;An odd fish, indeed.
And he seemed to have some sort of a hidden
meaning behind his words as he went out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A threat,&#8221; said Ben, thoughtfully; &#8220;undoubtedly
a threat. He seemed to object to
my watching him as I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the way he started, and the rage he
flew into when you joked him about also being
at Bunker Hill. It was peculiar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if he was there&mdash;and I am, somehow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
now inclined so think he was&mdash;why does he
desire to keep it hidden? All whom I have
met who took part in that fight have been
proud of it. Indeed, most have made it a
boast.&#8221; Ben paused for a moment, deep in
thought; then he suddenly leaped up.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; cried the Porcupine, all alert,
and also rising.</p>

<p>But seeing that he was attracting attention,
Ben resumed his seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; said he, calmly enough. And
when the dwarf had done so, he leaned across
the table and continued in a low-pitched voice:
&#8220;Master Hawkins was present at the Bunker
Hill fight. My watching him so intently,
and my later jest have convinced him that I
saw him there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said the Porcupine, not understanding,
&#8220;he seemed afraid. Why should he fear
you seeing him there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only one reason in the world,&#8221;
replied Ben Cooper, and his voice sank lower
than ever, &#8220;and that is that he was upon the
side of the enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Porcupine sank back into his chair;
his lips formed a circle, and he blew out his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
breath hissingly. Then with one finger he
pointed at Ben and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right. You&#8217;re exactly right. It
couldn&#8217;t be anything else. He belongs to
Howe&#8217;s army, and he&#8217;s here for no good.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ben was silent; he too, so it appeared,
was convinced that the man&#8217;s presence in the
city had an evil meaning. And the Porcupine,
as he watched his comrade, felt sure that
its possible intent suggested itself to him.
Ben stared into the fire, his chin in his
hands, and the dwarf heard him mutter:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! Such a thing is almost impossible.
It might enter the minds of the enemy
to attempt it; but it could not be carried out,
for no American would lend himself to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was some little time before Ben aroused
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had almost forgotten Master Morris and
the dispatch,&#8221; said he as he looked at the
coffee room clock. &#8220;You get to bed, Porcupine,
for there&#8217;s no knowing how long I shall
be gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pulled on his heavy coat, and felt of his
inner pockets to be sure that his message was
safe; then with a parting word to the dwarf,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
he left the inn. The streets were very quiet
at that hour; the stars looked cold and far
away; the stones rang under his spurred heel.</p>

<p>There was a light burning behind a curtain
in the Morris house.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s home, I think,&#8221; said the lad, &#8220;and
perhaps sitting up, awaiting my return.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben ascended the high stone steps and
sounded the knocker gently. There was a
pause, then a step was heard in the hall, a bar
fell, a chain rattled and the door swung open.
To his great astonishment, Ben saw standing
before him, a lighted candle above his head,
the gentleman who had supped with Livingstone
and Hawkins at the inn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I desire to see Master Robert Morris,&#8221; said
the lad.</p>

<p>The other inspected him closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you, by any chance, call here earlier
in the evening?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did, and left a note saying that I would
return.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door was held open to its fullest extent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben Cooper entered the hall; the other then
closed the door and led the way to an apartment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
where several candles burned in long
silver candlesticks upon a writing table.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reached home only a short time ago,&#8221;
said the gentleman, after they had become
seated, &#8220;and was startled to find myself the
cause of delay. The general&#8217;s dispatches are
usually urgent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben took out a folded paper sealed in
several places.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are Mr. Robert Morris?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; replied the gentleman.</p>

<p>Upon receiving the paper he at once broke
the seal, and drawing one of the candles nearer,
proceeded to read. When he reached the
end of the message, his lips were compressed
and a troubled expression appeared in his
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid it was something like this,&#8221;
he said, shaking his head. &#8220;The wants of
the army are urgent, I know, but money is
very difficult to get just now.&#8221; He looked at
Ben and tapped the edge of the refolded
paper upon the writing table. &#8220;It is a matter
of wonderment what becomes of the hard
money at times,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;When it is
the most urgently needed, it is the scarcest.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Ben, &#8220;I think may be said
about most things.&#8221;</p>

<p>The financier of the Revolution smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that&#8217;s true enough. But
money is the worst of all. Let me see.&#8221; The
speaker pulled open a drawer and took out a
book. &#8220;What were the last moneys I sent to
the general?&#8221; He turned page after page,
running his finger down each.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here it is,&#8221; pausing at an entry. &#8220;There
were four hundred and ten Spanish dollars,
two crowns, ten shillings and sixpence English,
and one French half-crown.&#8221; He closed the
ledger and sat regarding it with nodding head.
&#8220;A small sum, indeed, to supply a general in
the field; it could not go far.&#8221; He was silent
for a space; then he opened the message once
more, and reread what Washington had
written. &#8220;This time such a pittance will not
answer. The call is more urgent; a large sum
must be had. But,&#8221; and his chin sank upon
his breast, &#8220;where shall I ask for it? Where
has my credit not been tried?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a long time he sat buried in thought,
apparently oblivious of the boy&#8217;s presence.
Finally he arose and began pacing up and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
down the apartment, his hands behind him
and his brows puckered thoughtfully. One,
two, three hours were struck upon the great bell
in the State House tower; Ben was nodding
in the comfortable chair which had been given
him; the financier, with muttering lips and
mind concentrated upon the problem before
him, continued his pacing. At three o&#8217;clock he
sat down and began to go through documents,
books and files; with a blunt quill he scratched
notes upon a slip of paper. It was past four
o&#8217;clock when he pushed the mass from him
and arose; twice had he replaced the candles,
and the last were now guttering and flickering
in the sockets of their supports. Mr. Morris
was putting on his cloak when his eyes fell
upon the relaxed form of the drowsy youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;My poor lad,&#8221; he said, astonishment and
then amusement showing in his face, &#8220;I had
really forgotten all about you. It is too bad
of me, but I was so taken up by these affairs
of mine that everything else was completely
shut out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was told to await an answer,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;and believe me, sir, I have passed a much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
longer and less comfortable time often enough
and upon less important business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very good to say so,&#8221; replied the
merchant. He took up his hat, and in the
act of placing it upon his head, a thought
seemed to occur to him. &#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;you are not even yet too fatigued to prolong
your share in this matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; replied Ben Cooper, arising and lifting
a hand, military fashion, &#8220;I am ready and
willing to give what time you require to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said Mr. Morris, nodding his
head in a satisfied way. &#8220;You have the making
of an excellent soldier in you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>After settling the long comforter about his
neck, the merchant went to a low chest of
drawers and took from it a pistol.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust you are armed,&#8221; said he, as he examined
this. Without a word Ben showed
the pistol and short hanger which he wore
buttoned under his greatcoat. &#8220;Good,&#8221; said
Mr. Morris. &#8220;If I have fortune attending me,
I shall have a large sum in hard money before
very long; and it will be as well to be prepared
to defend it against highwaymen, if any be
abroad.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>Without any clear understanding of the
nature of this errand, Ben Cooper followed the
comfortable looking Mr. Morris into the street;
the dawn was paling the sky in the direction
of the Delaware, and the air had a penetrating
chill which made him shiver. Not very far
did they go before Mr. Morris ascended a pair
of steps and beat a tattoo upon the knocker.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be a much astonished man,
Jethro Sharpless,&#8221; chuckled the merchant,
&#8220;and there will be many like you before the
dawn comes up on the New Year.&#8221;</p>

<p>In reply to the vigorous rapping upon the
door, a window went up, a head popped out
and a complaining voice demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it that comes at such an hour as
this? Be off with thee or I will summon the
watch and have thee taken to the lock-up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that you, Jethro Sharpless?&#8221; asked
Merchant Morris. &#8220;This is your friend
Robert Morris, who bids you come down as
soon as you may and hear what news is come
from the Jerseys.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_054.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;THIS IS YOUR FRIEND
ROBERT MORRIS&#8221;</i></p>

<p>There was an exclamation above, and the
window closed hastily. The announcement
by Mr. Morris was in a clear, round voice and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
in the quiet of the early morning it carried
surprisingly. From across the way an anxious
voice called:</p>

<p>&#8220;What news is it that you bring, Neighbor
Morris? Good or bad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, did my knocking awaken you, Robert
Chaney? Arouse you, then!&#8221; Mr. Morris
had his face toward the place where the voice
had sounded.</p>

<p>Apparently the rat-tat-tat upon the door of
Friend Sharpless had brought others out of
their warm beds to learn what was going forward.
At any rate there came a full half
dozen voices from as many different points, all
charged with suspense:</p>

<p>&#8220;What say you, Morris? What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has a battle been fought?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Cornwallis crossed a state so soon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How went the fight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did our troops give a good account of
themselves?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Robert Morris offered them scant satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will have to gather round about, my
good friends, before I relieve myself of my
budget. I have news of the first importance&mdash;news<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
that must come home to every real
friend of the cause.&#8221; Here the door of the
Sharpless house opened, and the nightcapped
householder showed himself, candle in hand.
&#8220;You will find me in the parlor of Jethro
Sharpless; and any of you, who care to hear
what General Washington himself says, will
gather there at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the parlor, Mr. Sharpless, who was a
tall, bony man, with scraggy, gray brows,
placed his brass candlestick upon the table and
looked at the two who had so disturbed his
sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;News from the Jerseys,&#8221; said he, his
scraggy brows drawn together with anxiety.
&#8220;And what has been toward, Friend Morris?
Has there been a swording and a bickering
with the guns? Or has the army retreated
once more?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Morris took a seat at one corner of a
settle, crossed his legs and balanced his three-cornered
hat in his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy,&#8221; said he, quietly, &#8220;there will be
a number of your neighbors here in a few
moments, Friend Sharpless; so, perhaps, we
had better save the news until they arrive.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>With as good a grace as may be, the householder
set about waiting; and in no great
while Mr. Morris was surrounded by a ring of
eager faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come now, the news,&#8221; was demanded of
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never say it was anything but a victory,&#8221;
said a second.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trenton has but whetted our appetite,&#8221;
declared another. &#8220;Americans can beat the
British as readily as they can the Hessians, so
let&#8217;s to the news of how they did it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Merchant Morris regarded them with his
shrewd eyes. He knew every man of them;
they were persons of means and circumstance;
none in the entire city more capable than they
when matters of credit or ready money were
discussed.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; spoke Mr. Morris, carefully, &#8220;you
desire a victory, do you, my friends? Very
good. Not one of you is more desirous of it
than I. And no one more willing to point
out to you how it can be gotten than I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; demanded Friend Sharpless, &#8220;has
there not been a fight won, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A fight won!&#8221; replied Robert Morris,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
scornfully. &#8220;A fight won! And with what,
pray?&#8221; He looked from one to the other of
them. &#8220;Would you ask a man to dig and
give him no spade? Would you require a
man to build and provide him with no bricks?
You would not! You are all too shrewd for
that&mdash;too well acquainted with the wisdom of
practical things. But still you would have a
general win battles without an army; you
would have him face the ice of winter without
shoes or blankets for his scanty force; you
would have him keep the field in all the rigor
of the season with no medical help for his sick;
you would have him front a powerful foe with
only a few muskets and artillery of the poorest.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this there was no answer, save a look of
gloom from each of the circle. Robert Morris
went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the cause and you have the
general. Put the power into the general&#8217;s
hands, and the cause is won.&#8221; There
was a pause, and the speaker drew out the
dispatch which Ben Cooper had brought
from Trenton. &#8220;It is, perhaps, in your
minds,&#8221; proceeded the financier, &#8220;as to what
form this paper is to take. My reply is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
simple. Funds! Hard money! I do not
expect you to fill the empty treasure chest.
Merely cover its bottom and it will suffice for
a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Times,&#8221; spoke one with a shake of the
head, &#8220;are hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready money is difficult to come by,&#8221;
added another.</p>

<p>&#8220;The war has ruined trade,&#8221; bemoaned another.
&#8220;A gold or silver coin is a rarity
nowadays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said Robert Morris, apparently
paying no heed to their complaints, &#8220;is the
letter of His Excellency.&#8221; He read the lines
with proper emphasis and clearness, and as he
was refolding the sheet continued: &#8220;You see,
sirs, it is a rather large sum that is required;
but consider, also, that the need of it is much
larger still. A crisis has been reached in the
country&#8217;s affairs that must be met with swiftness
and generosity; if it is not, then never
look for a sign of peace until all the sources
of supply whatsoever have been drained. By
lending a part to the cause at this time, you
may save the whole, eventually.&#8221;</p>

<p>He placed the dispatch in his pocket and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
sat awaiting a response. There was a long
silence: each man seemed to prefer that his
neighbor speak first. There was none of the
eagerness of real patriotism which once impelled
men to rush to the defense of their native
land; their manners were more like those of
gloomy pessimists who foresaw nothing but
disaster and whose remembrance of self impelled
them to think only of what might be
saved from the ruins of their cause. Keen-eyed
Robert Morris perceived this at once; it
was nothing more, apparently, than he had
expected; but like the courageous man that
he was, he continued to strive, even in the
face of defeat.</p>

<p>Picture after picture was drawn by him of
what would befall should the army not receive
the required money; he left nothing to
the imagination; Washington would be driven
beyond the western mountains; Philadelphia
would fall; taxation would hang upon them
like a chain upon a felon.</p>

<p>But his eloquence failed to move them;
their heavy faces ringed about him unbelievingly;
the doubt in their hearts seemed to fill
the room. At length Morris arose.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I cannot remain to reason
with you longer, friends. The money must
be had swiftly, if it&#8217;s to do any good; so I
must call upon some one more promising before
it is too late. Should any of you chance to
alter your minds,&#8221; he added, pausing at the
door, &#8220;you know where I live. I shall be
very glad, indeed, to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>With Ben Cooper at his side he left the
house of Jethro Sharpless, and proceeded to
another house at no great distance; but with
no better fortune. Then began a hurried round
from house to house, a hammering at knockers
and a rousing of quiet citizens from their beds.
Excuses, apologies and promises were many.</p>

<p>&#8220;But no hard money,&#8221; said the financier to
Ben. &#8220;Nothing that will help an army desperately
circumstanced for arms and clothing
and food.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dawn had passed, and the streets were
well peopled by those starting upon the early
duties of the day when Robert Morris with
empty hands and haggard face gave up the
hopeless task.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ashamed of my fellow townsmen,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;They are without a particle of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
daring necessary to bring a cause to the point
where success may be had.&#8221;</p>

<p>Side by side he and Ben walked back toward
the Morris house; the merchant&#8217;s head was
bent, his moody eyes were upon the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will write a letter to the general which
you will be good enough to carry,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Perhaps in a few days I shall be more
fortunate in my appeals for help, and will say
so in the letter; if you are asked any questions,
it will be as well, perhaps, if you place the
matter in as hopeful a light as you can. It
will not do to allow any definite discouragement
to gain circulation at this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Merchant Morris was interrupted by a
quiet voice saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Friend Morris; thou art
early upon thy affairs to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a tall, quiet-faced Quaker, wrapped
in a gray woolen shawl, and with his broad-brimmed
hat pulled well down.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a pressing matter, though no more
my own than yours, friend, which compels
me to be early astir,&#8221; replied Morris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the Quaker. &#8220;Some affair of
Congress, or the army.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>&#8220;A most active necessity,&#8221; said Morris.
He drew off his gloves, took out Washington&#8217;s
letter and read it aloud once more. When he
had concluded, he added: &#8220;You see, it was
not a thing to be dandled over.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tall Quaker nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;As thou sayest, friend, a most pressing
business, indeed.&#8221; He looked at Merchant
Morris for a moment with quiet eyes. &#8220;What
sum does General Washington mention?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifty thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a great deal.&#8221; Again came the
pause; then he continued in the same unruffled
voice, &#8220;Friend Robert, what security
canst thou offer against a loan of such size?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My note and my honor,&#8221; promptly.</p>

<p>The Quaker smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;More no man could ask,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Thou
shalt have it, but,&#8221; with a wave of the hand,
&#8220;thou must allow me one day to gather the
sum together, since it must be in coin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Friend,&#8221; said Robert Morris, delightedly,
&#8220;I am greatly beholden to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By this evening, then,&#8221; said the other, as
he started on his way, &#8220;you may expect it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>When he had gone, Ben Cooper fell in silently
by the side of Mr. Morris. Already the
latter was planning the next step.</p>

<p>&#8220;You rode from Trenton yesterday,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;and because of me have had no sleep
during the night. It would be too much to
ask you to take horse again this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it is necessary,&#8221; spoke Ben, &#8220;you need
only give me the word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent! Then, if that is your spirit,
I say to you that it is necessary. What is the
earliest hour you can reach the camp?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By sundown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. I will not detain you to write
a letter. Merely say to the general that fifty
thousand dollars will be on its way to him in
a swift carriage by the time your message is
delivered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seeing that there was no more to be said,
Ben saluted the financier, military fashion,
and started at a brisk pace for the City Tavern.
Within an hour both he and the Porcupine
had breakfasted and were in the saddle,
headed for Washington&#8217;s camp on the upper
Delaware.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>HOW GOOD NEWS CAME TO TRENTON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two young riders clung to the western
side of the river upon the return journey; it
is true that panic, after the disaster at Trenton,
had cleared the stations below of the
Hessians, but Ben knew that a British army
would soon be on its way to attempt to drive
Washington back, and he did not feel at all
sure that the enemy were not in possession of
Burlington and Bordentown once more.</p>

<p>Some distance above Bristol they detected
a small party of horsemen on the road ahead,
and approached slowly, their pistols ready at
hand. But the sharp eyes of Ben Cooper soon
made out the party, and he gave a laugh of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Nat and the two Prentiss boys,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Out on a scout, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three youths mentioned had recognized
them about the same time, and now came on
with shouts of greeting.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>&#8220;What news?&#8221; asked Ben of the most stalwart
of the three, a lad with bronzed face and
keen eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;The army has recrossed the river,&#8221; replied
Nat Brewster. &#8220;The last of them went over
early to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of the enemy?&#8221; demanded the
Porcupine, still fingering his huge pistol.</p>

<p>The boys all laughed at his belligerent attitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are on the way to meet us,&#8221; replied
Ezra Prentiss. &#8220;We heard something of it
before we left camp. They say that Lord
Cornwallis was just about to take ship for
England when the word of the taking of
Trenton reached General Howe; and now he
is back in the Jerseys at the head of their
force once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;News was brought in that the enemy have
gathered all their scattered forces at Princeton,&#8221;
said George Prentiss, twin brother to
Ezra. &#8220;Cornwallis brought with him a
strong reinforcement of picked troops, and
with those of Grant there are some eight
thousand of them ready to march if they have
not already started.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>The three youths had been on the other
side of the river seeking traces of the enemy
from that direction, but finding none had
crossed the stream upon a flatboat, thinking
to fall in with Ben, as they had done. All
five now started north having made up their
minds to cross the river at the point where
the troops had effected their latest passage.
The Prentiss twins rode on ahead, while Ben
Cooper and his stalwart cousin, Nat Brewster,
followed some little distance behind. A great
deal of news had made its way into the
American camp during Ben&#8217;s two days&#8217; absence,
through scouts, spies and deserting
Hessians, and Nat knew that the other would
be eager to hear it all.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are pressing<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> wagons on every
hand,&#8221; said young Brewster; &#8220;when we left,
we heard that their advance pickets were
very near to Trenton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is thought of the situation at headquarters?&#8221;
asked Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;From a word here and a word there, I
gather that they are rather anxious. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
winning of Trenton, however, has roused the
Jerseys at last, and the militia is beginning to
rise. Cadwallader and Mifflin have been
ordered in with their commands and should
reach camp to-day. The general seems to
have made up his mind to fight, but it looks
to me that he will now have to do so whether
he would or no, for the enemy is before and
the river is behind. And this time he must
not retreat, for to do that would dishearten
the Jerseymen and the country as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys reached Washington&#8217;s camp
shortly after dark, and Ben instantly presented
himself at headquarters. As he stood,
saluting in an outer room, a smart young
officer demanded his business.</p>

<p>&#8220;To see the general.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your business,&#8221; said the young officer,
curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A message from Mr. Robert Morris, at
Philadelphia,&#8221; said Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take it to the general,&#8221; the other
informed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My message is by word of mouth,&#8221; said
Ben, &#8220;and is, perhaps, of an urgent and
private nature.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>&#8220;Wait here,&#8221; said the young officer as he
arose. He spent but a very few moments in
the inner room; and when he returned he was
as curt and businesslike as before.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are to go in,&#8221; said he, and one finger
indicated the door.</p>

<p>When Ben entered the room where Washington
sat, he found him engaged with two
other officers. These were Mifflin and Cadwallader,
leaders of Pennsylvania militia,
who had but a few hours before arrived in
camp with their combined force, approaching
four thousand men.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am grateful to you, gentlemen,&#8221; the
commander-in-chief was saying. &#8220;It is not
always,&#8221; a trifle bitterly, &#8220;that my desires are
so promptly answered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are under your directions,&#8221; said
General Mifflin, coldly; &#8220;and we trust that
we know some of the duties that devolve
upon under officers.&#8221;</p>

<p>General Cadwallader glanced at his brother
officer as though the tone, the words and the
manner were not agreeable to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got your orders at Crosswicks&mdash;joined
Mifflin accordingly, and set out.&#8221; The tone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
and manner here were eager, soldier-like, and
respectful. &#8220;I hope, general, you have some
good fighting to offer us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Washington paid no attention to the attitude
of Mifflin; to Cadwallader he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is more than likely that there will be a
clash in a day or two that will put a decided
point upon the affairs of the states; and if it&#8217;s
fighting you seek, general,&#8221; with a smile, &#8220;I
think we can please you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not get across the river to be of
assistance to you a week ago,&#8221; said Cadwallader,
&#8220;and have since been prevented by
lack of enemies from being of service.
Pennsylvania wants her troops in action, and
I am only too eager to try them under fire in
an engagement of consequence.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a great deal passed upon both
sides; but through it all General Mifflin said
nothing, sitting coldly erect with a face of
stony indifference. At length General Washington
noticed the lad in the doorway, his hand
still raised in the gesture of salute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Cooper,&#8221; said he, concerned; &#8220;I had
let you slip my mind. Pomroy just now told
me that you had returned.&#8221; Then, leaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
over his table, eagerly, &#8220;What letters do you
bring me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None, sir,&#8221; replied the boy. &#8220;Master
Morris bade me tell you what he had to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>A shadow crossed the grave face of the
commander-in-chief; evidently this, to his
mind, promised no good.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told Master Morris that I should reach
camp by sundown to-day; and he said that I
was to inform you that, by then, a swift carriage
would be on its way, bearing fifty thousand
dollars for the use of the army.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cloud passed from General Washington&#8217;s
face like magic; a look of great satisfaction
replaced it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I felt sure,&#8221; to
the other officers, &#8220;that Morris would not fail
me, if it were at all possible to procure the
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The nation is indeed fortunate to have
the services of so able a man in the capacity
in which he is serving,&#8221; said Cadwallader.
&#8220;In the matter of finance, Morris is little
short of a wizard.&#8221; After a few more questions,
Ben was told that was all, and retired.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>At once he sought out his friends, where they
sat about a fire preparing their supper along
with some others. And during their meal
there was much gossip exchanged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cornwallis will be upon us to-morrow,&#8221;
said a young sergeant of horse, who was of
the party. &#8220;We have all day been catching
sight of light bodies thrown out in advance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard that Howe himself has
landed a couple of regiments at Amboy and
is on the march,&#8221; spoke another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let him come,&#8221; said a youthful
artilleryman; &#8220;the more of them, the greater
chance we will have at them with the shells.
To reach us they must cross the Assanpink
Creek a little below there; the stone bridge
is narrow, and the water is deep and our
guns are so planted as to sweep it from end to
end.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some few hours were spent in pleasant
fashion, chatting and discussing the prospects
of the coming fight. Later Nat and Ben
found themselves without the lines of sparkling
fires; a little distance away they could
hear the sentries pacing up and down, and now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
and then the rattle of a piece of artillery wheeling
into place would reach their ears. Somehow,
as the thought of the approaching battle
grew upon them, they had become graver, and
so fell into a talk concerning family things and
interests which had nothing in common with
their friends; and so they had arisen and
strolled away.</p>

<p>The night was a quiet one; the city of
Trenton lay before them like some gloomy,
crouching thing awaiting its fate on the morrow;
had not their military experience told
them that their pickets lay all about them
with masked fires, they would have fancied
the countryside deserted. Ben had just been
speaking feelingly of his father, whom he had
not had time to call upon while in Philadelphia,
and they stood leaning against the
tongue of an empty baggage wagon, deep in
the softer reflections which home and home
things bring uppermost. Then they were
aroused by the sound of voices and footsteps,
and the flash of a tinder box showed them two
men standing at the door of a small house
which the boys in the semi-darkness had not
before noted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>&#8220;Ah, I can see it now,&#8221; said one of them.
&#8220;The step is broken, and I have missed a
nasty fall more than once.&#8221;</p>

<p>The flash died out almost instantly, and the
two men stood in the shadows for a moment
in silence. Then the second one spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole matter has reached an acute
pass, General Mifflin; a great many of our
citizens demand to know the facts, and I
thought that perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The cold voice of Mifflin interrupted:</p>

<p>&#8220;But why have you selected me as the one
best calculated to give you information? I
have not been with the main command; and
the fact is, I know nothing, except by hearsay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you know the man; you were with
him at the first, were you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was an aide when he first was made what
he is. But the candid fact is that I was never
attracted by him, and therefore gave him little
attention, save in the way of duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again there was a silence; then the other
spoke once more:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry that this is the case. I had
hoped that you would be of much assistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
to us in coming to a proper knowledge of the
situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can tell you nothing that any one could
not tell you,&#8221; insisted Mifflin.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are the prospects for an immediate
action?&#8221; asked the second man, after a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;So far as I can learn&mdash;excellent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what are the chances for success?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As good as ever. Strangely enough, our
army is still possessed of the fighting spirit, in
spite of their wretched condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; The voice of the other had an
eager note deep in it, which attracted the instant
attention of Ben Cooper. &#8220;I had heard
that they were not well conditioned or provided
for. Also I hear that the general has
found it not at all easy to come by supplies of
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt all have heard such rumors,&#8221;
said Mifflin; &#8220;I, too, have met with them.
But as to money being hard to procure, I am
not sure. While I was with Washington only
a short time ago, the news came that fifty
thousand dollars in coin was on its way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here?&#8221; asked the other.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>&#8220;Here, to be sure,&#8221; replied Mifflin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the man, and again the eager
note in his voice attracted Ben Cooper, &#8220;that
is interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Washington seemed to find it so,&#8221; replied
Mifflin, drily. Then he added: &#8220;And now,
sir, if you will pardon me, I think I shall try
and get some sleep. I have had a hard day
and by all appearance to-morrow will be much
harder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon the other, apparently not at all
satisfied, judging from his tone, bade the general
good-night; Mifflin entered his headquarters,
where a light at once appeared, while
the other man strode away into the darkness.</p>

<p>Nat Brewster was the first to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said he, &#8220;was a queer sort of thing.
I don&#8217;t quite understand it.&#8221; Pondering a
moment, he added: &#8220;Evidently this man who
was with General Mifflin had come on an
errand concerning the strength or weakness
of a certain person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that person,&#8221; said Ben Cooper, without
hesitation, &#8220;is none other than General
Washington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Nat; &#8220;the general it is.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>&#8220;But,&#8221; and there was a mystified quality
in Ben&#8217;s voice and manner, &#8220;while that interests
me, still there is something which attracts
me still more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to know who that man is.&#8221;
Ben pointed in the direction taken by Mifflin&#8217;s
late companion, and Nat understood at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;So?&#8221; said he. &#8220;And why are you so
much interested in him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somehow,&#8221; said Ben, &#8220;while he talked I
seemed to recognize his voice&mdash;not so much
its general quality, as a note that came into it
now and then. It told of a sort of eagerness&mdash;a
desire to learn something, which I seem
strangely familiar with. And oddly enough,
it strikes me that it was not so long ago that
I heard it. It seems as though&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Here
he paused, and through the semi-darkness his
hand reached out and grasped Nat&#8217;s arm
tightly. &#8220;I know who it was,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It
was a man whom I met at the City Tavern in
Philadelphia only last night&mdash;a man of the
name of Tobias Hawkins!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>IN WHICH AN ARMY CREPT AWAY IN THE NIGHT<br />
AND FOUGHT THE BATTLE OF PRINCETON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> had no proper rest on the previous
night, Ben slept well on that night of the first
of January; early in the morning, however,
he was up and had snatched his breakfast and
was in the saddle.</p>

<p>Washington had selected a position for his
main body on the east side of the Assanpink
and, as the young artilleryman had said the
night before, the batteries were so planted
as to sweep the stone bridge over that stream,
and the fords. Word came in by Ezra and
George Prentiss, who had taken horse in the
small hours of the morning, that the main
body of Lord Cornwallis was advancing. At
once strong parties were sent out under General
Greene; these met and engaged advance
parties of British, or hung upon the flanks of
the main body like terriers, and so greatly
impeded their progress.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>It was noon, therefore, when Cornwallis
reached the north bank of the Shabbakong,
where he halted for a time; then he crossed
to the other side, when the light parties of
Americans once more began to worry him
with their rifle fire. Made angry by this, the
British charged into the woods and dislodged
their annoyers; afterward they pushed on with
little or no interference until they reached
the high ground outside Trenton. Here Colonel
Hand&#8217;s body of riflemen poured out such
a warm greeting that the British were for the
time checked. But in a little while orders
were sent to Hand to fall back, as the ground
was not thought to be one upon which the
struggle could be undertaken with advantage.</p>

<p>When the riflemen retreated upon the main
body of the American force, it was almost
sunset; in a fury at being so delayed, Cornwallis
rushed his troops through the town of
Trenton, formed them into columns and attempted
to cross the Assanpink by the stone
bridge and the fords.</p>

<p>But a storm of bullets and solid shot drove
him back; again and again the gallant Briton
hurled his force at the crossings, but each time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
the batteries sent them reeling back. Washington,
mounted upon his white horse, was
stationed at the American end of the bridge
giving his orders in person; and each time
the enemy was repulsed the lines of his soldiers
roared their approval.</p>

<p>During all this time the British cannon
were by no means silent; they thundered and
smoked and hurled their missiles with all the
skill of their handlers, but with little damage
to the Americans. Then, as the night had
closed in, Cornwallis hushed their anger,
ceased his attempts to cross the creek, and
went into camp.</p>

<p>Ben Cooper and his friends stood watching
the fires of the enemy gleaming in the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put off until another day,&#8221; said Ben,
soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought, by the way it began, that we&#8217;d
know victory or defeat by this,&#8221; remarked
George Prentiss.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long do you think we&#8217;ll be able to
hold them?&#8221; asked Nat Brewster of Ezra
Prentiss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cornwallis is a general of resource and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
enterprise,&#8221; replied Ezra. &#8220;To-day he has
tried a direct forcing of our front; to-morrow
he will adopt different measures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Ben Cooper,
still more soberly than before. &#8220;And that
means that he&#8217;ll begin flanking movements
and other things in which his veteran troops
will have a tremendous advantage over our
untrained militia.&#8221;</p>

<p>To guard against a surprise, or to be ready
to receive the enemy in the early morning
should he wait so long before attacking, the
Americans kept their weapons beside them.
Washington patrolled his camp with care and
anxiety; it was a night of terrible suspense;
never before since the beginning of the war
had the Americans risked so much upon the
outcome of a single struggle; defeat meant
annihilation.</p>

<p>The commander-in-chief, accompanied by a
few officers, paused in his rounds at no great
distance from where the boys stood. Sitting
erect in his saddle, he examined the fires of
Cornwallis with speculative eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;They sleep as though feeling their prey
secure,&#8221; said General Greene.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>&#8220;Our discipline is not great enough to hold
him back,&#8221; said Washington, his gaze still
upon the watch-fires of the enemy; &#8220;a front
to front engagement is out of the question.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys saw Greene turn a look upon his
fellow officers; it was plain that, from this, he
expected something more. And he was not
disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;By this time,&#8221; said General Washington,
in a quiet way and with the manner of a man
who is weighing something of vital import,
&#8220;the greater part of the enemy must be on its
way to Trenton, to assist in crushing us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think there is scarcely any doubt of
that,&#8221; answered Greene. &#8220;We have given my
Lord Cornwallis a taste of our mettle lately,
and he&#8217;ll not trifle with us, you may depend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They will be drawn from Princeton,&#8221; said
Washington, &#8220;in detachments of no great
strength. If encountered, a competent force
could beat them in detail. And then Brunswick,
where all their baggage and stores lie,
would be left practically undefended.&#8221;</p>

<p>General Greene drew in his breath sharply;
the other officers stirred in their saddles, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
eyes gleaming expectantly in the firelight.
Washington, who had made no sign that he
had noted the proximity of his young riders,
now surprised them by suddenly facing them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prentiss,&#8221; said he, singling out Ezra; and
the latter at once advanced to the side of the
great white horse. The commander-in-chief
said: &#8220;When you brought in your information
as to the movements of the enemy, this morning,
did you not say that a force was left
behind a little way out of Trenton, as a rear
guard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About six miles, or half-way to Princeton,
general,&#8221; answered Ezra promptly. &#8220;It is
under command of General Leslie; I saw him
plainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they were on the direct road between
Trenton and Princeton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, general.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ezra fell back to his friends; the commander
turned to his officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is another way to Princeton&mdash;a more
circuitous one, known as the Quaker Road,&#8221;
said Washington. &#8220;Do you think, Mercer,&#8221;
to the Virginian officer who was in the group,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
&#8220;that a movement could be successfully made
in that direction?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of it,&#8221; declared General Mercer,
enthusiastically. &#8220;A quick march, a blow
when they least expect it at Princeton, destroy
what baggage they&#8217;ve left there&mdash;and then a
rush upon Brunswick, where we can deal them
a blow that will cripple them.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a chorus of voices raised in praise
of the proposition. But Washington&#8217;s hand
went up.</p>

<p>&#8220;First,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we will discuss the matter
in detail. And as your quarters are the
nearest, Mercer,&#8221; to his friend, &#8220;we will go
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>At once the party of general officers turned
their horses&#8217; heads toward the house where
Mercer was lodged. What took place there
the lads never knew, but that the plan which
Washington had so sketched was finally agreed
upon in detail was evident before an hour had
passed.</p>

<p>Swiftly the order was given; the teamsters
and the baggage were soon silently on their way
to Burlington. Intrenching tools were brought
forward with great bustle, and numbers of men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
were set vigorously to work near the bridge and
each ford, throwing up earthworks. With
much clatter and loud talking this work went
forward in the hearing of the British sentinels
across the creek. Camp-fires were kept burning,
and from time to time guards were relieved
in such a manner that the enemy could not
help being aware of it.</p>

<p>And while this was going forward, the main
body of the army noiselessly slipped away
toward Princeton. The progress was slow at
first, because the roads were soft; but suddenly
the direction of the wind altered, the cold became
intense, and the wagon way froze to the
hardness of iron.</p>

<p>The orders were that the men left behind to
deceive the enemy were to continue on the
Assanpink until daybreak, when they were
to abandon their pretense and hasten after the
army. General Mercer commanded the advance
party along the Quaker Road which,
being new and encumbered with stumps, made
slow traveling.</p>

<p>It was about sunrise when the army reached
the bridge at Stony Brook, three miles from
Princeton. Ben Cooper and his friends, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
were detailed with Mercer&#8217;s advance party,
heard that officer say to one of his aides:</p>

<p>&#8220;We should have been entering the town
by this. I&#8217;m afraid that daylight will expose
our movements.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mercer, under orders, took up his course
along the brook; Washington led the main
body into a by-road which his guides claimed
was a short cut into Princeton. It was Mercer&#8217;s
intent to seize or destroy a bridge on the
main road, so as to prevent the flight of the
British when Washington attacked them.</p>

<p>Along trailed Mercer, following the stream,
and away marched Washington by the side
road; they had gone some little way toward
their objective points, and still the enemy had
not perceived them. However, before Mercer
reached the bridge, the British 17th, under
Colonel Mawhood, crossed it on the way to
Trenton, where they had been ordered. The
glitter of the rifle barrels of Mercer&#8217;s men
attracted the attention of some one in the 17th,
and Mawhood was instantly on the alert. It
was impossible for the British to make out
the full strength of the Americans, owing to
the thick woods; but probably the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
leader fancied them a detachment flying from
a possible defeat at Trenton; and so made up
his mind to capture them.</p>

<p>Swift riders were sent spurring back to
Princeton to inform two additional regiments,
also under marching orders, of the condition
of affairs; once these were on the ground, so
Mawhood reasoned, the Americans could be
surrounded.</p>

<p>The van of Mercer&#8217;s brigade was nearing
the desired bridge when Ben Cooper, riding
ahead, made out the scarlet of the British
through the naked trees. Instantly his holster
pistol was out and he had fired a shot of
warning; whirling about his mount he dashed
back to the companions he had left a little
while before. The alarm shot had startled
the American officers into instant action;
Mercer galloped up and at once saw the task
before him. Like a trained soldier he glanced
about for a natural advantage; some high
ground to the right attracted him and he ordered
his men to make for it. The regiment
of Mawhood noted the vantage point about
the same time and also rushed to occupy it.</p>

<p>But the Americans were the first to reach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
the high ground and formed behind a hedge
fence. Their rifles at once opened upon the
British, who returned the fire with deadly accuracy.
Mercer&#8217;s horse was killed under him,
and several of his officers fell. A confusion
struck the American troops, and, noting this,
with comprehensive eye, Mawhood met the
situation like a master.</p>

<p>&#8220;With bayonet&mdash;charge!&#8221; he commanded.</p>

<p>With leveled muskets, each bayonet-tipped,
the British 17th rushed up the sides of the
elevation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meet them, lads,&#8221; shouted the brave
Mercer, who had freed himself from his dead
horse and was now upon his feet, sword in
hand. &#8220;Club your pieces! Meet them like
men!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the clubbed muskets were of little use
against the bristling steel of the onrushing
veterans; at the first onset the Americans
broke; Mercer tried to rally them, but was
struck down; with flashing blade he arose
and defended himself&mdash;but was pierced by a
half dozen bayonets, and the rush of the
enemy passed over his brave body.</p>

<p>To the crest of the hill charged the 17th,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
cheered on by Mawhood and his officers; once
there they came to a sudden halt, however,
for they saw a heavy body of troops emerging
from the woods and advancing toward them.</p>

<p>This was a regiment of Pennsylvania
militia which had been sent forward by
Washington upon the first volley from Mercer&#8217;s
brigade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give them the artillery,&#8221; directed the
businesslike Mawhood, as he watched the
Pennsylvanians pushing upon him.</p>

<p>In a moment the pieces of cannon which he
carried with him were brought into play, and
in the face of their heavy discharge, the
Americans, who were but recruits, halted and
began to waver. For a moment the situation
was strong with peril, and then Nat Brewster,
who stood with the Prentiss twins, Ben and
some score of the hardier spirits, behind a
fringe of trees, loading and firing like machines,
suddenly uttered a shout of joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not over yet,&#8221; said he, pointing to the
brow of a neighboring hill. There stood a
great white horse and upon it was a powerful,
erect rider, who surveyed the situation with
eagle glance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s General Washington!&#8221; shouted Ben
Cooper.</p>

<p>As he spoke the commander-in-chief dashed
down the side of the hill, the white charger
moving like the wind; with voice ringing
with confidence, he called up Mercer&#8217;s broken
force.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn and at them, my brave fellows.
Shall it be said that you ran with arms in
your hands?&#8221;</p>

<p>Here and there a man paused; and no
sooner had he done so than some others joined
him; in a few moments the breathless officers
were reforming them into lines and gasping
out words of encouragement. Through a
flight of bullets, Washington swept up and
down, giving orders, shouting encouragement,
waving his sword in circles of light. Never
was there a plainer mark for the stray bullet
which usually brings greatness down; but, as
Providence willed, none found it then.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvanians, wavering under the
cannon shot of Mawhood, saw this act of daring
on the part of their chief, and steadied
instantly. A battery of artillery now opened
upon the British from a hilltop, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
grape-shot began to cut them down. And, as
though this were not enough, a Virginia regiment
broke from out the woods and charged
furiously upon them.</p>

<p>Almost in a single moment Mawhood was
plunged from the height of success to a situation
of desperate danger. But he was skilful
and brave, and not the sort to fail in any kind
of action; with high courage he drove his men
at the ring that had all but closed him in and
fought his way back to the Trenton road.</p>

<p>Washington, as he dashed to and fro, as
much endangered by the fire of his own men
as that of the British, witnessed this gallant
effort of Mawhood&#8217;s with admiration; nevertheless
he sent a detachment of the Pennsylvanians
in pursuit with directions to break
down the bridge upon their return, in order
that General Leslie, of Cornwallis&#8217; rear guard,
might be delayed should he advance to attack
them before their task was done.</p>

<p>While this sharp encounter was in progress,
another British regiment, the 55th, was met
nearer Princeton by the American general St.
Clair; a steep ravine was the scene of this
struggle, which was brief but desperate; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
British broke and fled across the fields toward
Brunswick; seeing them in flight, the remaining
regiment, which had not come up
in time to be of assistance to their fellows, also
broke; a part of them hurried in the direction
of Brunswick, but a strong body threw themselves
into the college building at Princeton
and began a stubborn resistance.</p>

<p>They were firing from windows and from
protected parts of the roof when Ben Cooper,
bearing a dispatch from Washington to St.
Clair, rode up. As St. Clair tore open the
dispatch, he said grimly to one of his colonels:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring up the guns; we&#8217;ll try if this student
body can stand before a row of such
schoolmasters.&#8221;</p>

<p>The artillery wheeled into place and began
hurling their shot into the college. It took
but a few moments of this to bring the cry
for quarter from within. The doors were
flung open, and the Americans rushed into
the building, where the British had thrown
down their arms.</p>

<p>But some of them, apparently, had not
agreed to giving up so readily; and as the
victors rushed in at one end, they dashed for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
the windows at the other, leaped through and
went racing away. A party was dispatched
in pursuit, but later returned with only a
handful; the others had escaped in the woods.</p>

<p>Washington pursued the routed regiments
as far as Kingston; here, with his officers, he
held a council of war. It was decided that the
men were too worn out to push on to Brunswick
with any speed, and that Cornwallis would
be upon them before they could reach there.
The word was therefore given, and the army,
destroying bridges behind them, marched
away toward the wooded and frowning heights
about Morristown.</p>

<p>And as they went, Ben Cooper rode at the
side of Nat Brewster, his face thoughtful and
his manner strangely still. At length Nat
noticed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened?&#8221; he asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; replied Ben. &#8220;That is,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;nothing as yet. But I fear that
something&mdash;a something that neither you nor
I can put hands upon&mdash;will happen, and perhaps
at no distant time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat looked at him in surprise.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I, if it comes to that,&#8221; returned Ben.
Then after a short pause, he inquired: &#8220;Do
you recall my saying, last night, that I fancied
I heard, in conversation with General Mifflin,
the voice of a stranger whom I had encountered
in Philadelphia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Ben, and there was an odd
foreboding in his tone, &#8220;this morning, at one
of the windows of Princeton College, while
the British were escaping, I thought I saw his
face.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>TELLS HOW BEN COOPER ENCOUNTERED THE MAN<br />
WITH THE YELLOW SMILE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> retiring on the night before, Lord
Cornwallis had looked at the lines of American
camp-fires and listened to the sound of the
mattocks and spades at the east end of the
bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the morning,&#8221; said my lord, using the
language of the English huntsman, &#8220;I will
bag the fox.&#8221;</p>

<p>At daylight, however, the thunder of
cannon from the direction of Princeton awoke
him from his sleep; once without he saw the
dying watch-fires and deserted camp of the
Americans.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are gone,&#8221; said his general, Grant,
in a tone which was one of mixed wonder and
rage. &#8220;They have escaped us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again came the roar of guns from along
the Princeton road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Harken to that,&#8221; said Cornwallis, bitterly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
&#8220;They have probably not only escaped us,
but are making a rush upon Brunswick to
capture our stores.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the celerity of trained soldiers, the
British veterans got under way, and at top
speed, with their officers urging them on,
they marched toward Princeton. The Pennsylvania
militia had ceased their pursuit and
were engaged in destroying the bridge at
Stony Brook; it was partly down when the
cannon of Cornwallis drove them away; then,
unable to pass by way of the bridge, the
British, horse, foot and artillery, plunged into
the cold water and gained the other side.</p>

<p>But the delay at the bridge permitted the
Americans to draw a long and safe distance
away; and seeing that there was no hope of
overtaking them, Cornwallis pushed on to
Brunswick, thankful at least that his stores
were safe.</p>

<p>The American troops were still on the
march toward the hills when Ben was summoned
by an ensign to report to the commander-in-chief.
Riding through a press of
officers, his right hand at the salute, the boy
reached the side of Washington.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>&#8220;Is your mount fresh enough to make a
second journey to Philadelphia?&#8221; asked the
commander.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, general.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have another message for Mr. Robert
Morris; and as there is no time to write it,
you must carry it as you carried his to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben saluted.</p>

<p>&#8220;The money which he was to dispatch on
the night of the first has been delayed, so
Master Morris states in a letter received but
now. Say to him that the utmost care must
be exercised in the transportation of the coin,
because of the unsettled state of the roads; say
that I desire him to have a guard accompany
the carriage, and instruct the person in charge
to make for Morristown and not Trenton.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were some minor additions to this;
and upon receiving the order, Ben wheeled
his horse and rode back to his friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back to Philadelphia,&#8221; he announced,
&#8220;and at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>They gathered around him and offered
advice as to the most trustworthy way of making
his journey. It was no child&#8217;s task to cover
the ground between their present situation and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
the river, as they well knew. Ben shook
each of them by the hand and bid them good-bye;
then taking a rough by-road which ran
almost directly toward the Delaware, he
spurred forward upon his mission.</p>

<p>It was almost noon and the January sun
sparkled upon the snow-covered fields; lower
and redder it fell in the west until at length,
when he sighted the ice-packed Delaware, the
long shadows were stealing along the fringes
of woods and upon the eastern slopes of the
hills.</p>

<p>The cold which had so fortunately followed
the veering of the wind upon the night before,
freezing the soft road under the feet of the
American troops, had here served a like purpose.
The river was a solid mass and, after
a little examination, Ben had no hesitation in
venturing his horse upon it; the footing was
strong every step of the way and he arrived
upon the far side without any trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a piece of rare fortune,&#8221; muttered
Ben, as he sat in the saddle and looked back
at the long stretch of gray ice; &#8220;indeed, it
was by far the most uncertain part of the
journey.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>With a brief stop upon the river bank to
rest his horse he rode forward upon the way to
Bristol, and pulled up at the inn at that place
some time after dark. There was a cheery light
streaming through the inn windows; the sparks
that flew from the chimney told of a roaring
fire, and the scent of most excellent cooking
crept out of the keyholes and under the
doors. After his horse had been seen to, Ben
was about to enter, when the hostler, a pale
little man, with scant light hair, and mild
eyes, said rather hesitatingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;These be rather uncertain times upon the
road, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, and every other place,&#8221; answered Ben,
with a smile.</p>

<p>The pale little hostler shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the road is the worst of all, I think,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;For, you see, sir,&#8221; in explanation,
&#8220;the road is most frequented&mdash;especially a
road like this. And being a great deal
frequented,&#8221; ominously, &#8220;a great many desperate
characters are to be found upon it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben looked at him; there was something
in the mild face which held his attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; said the lad, &#8220;desperate characters.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
In wild times like these there are many
such, no doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may say so, young gentleman, you
may say so, indeed. We are in fair terror of
some of them, at times. They come here and
do as they please; and if we say but a word
they threaten our lives.&#8221; He paused and one
hand stroked the horse&#8217;s neck for a moment;
then he added: &#8220;Perhaps you wouldn&#8217;t care
to go in there,&#8221; with a nod toward the inn
door, &#8220;if you knew that one of that sort was
within.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben smiled good-naturedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I confess, friend, that I
have no great liking for such persons. But
as my business at this time brings me in contact
with more or less ungentle conduct, I
don&#8217;t suppose that I need put myself about
because of a trifle additional.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded, still smiling, to the little man,
and lifting the latch entered the inn. As he
had noted, the room was filled with candle-light;
a great fire of billets crackled and
blazed in the fireplace; and the smell of
savory dishes being prepared in copper saucepans
came with added distinctness to his nostrils.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Ben&#8217;s round face, fresh colored cheeks
and merry eyes always made him liked wherever
he went, and as he stood stamping the
snow from his boots in the doorway, he said
to the buxom landlady:</p>

<p>&#8220;A good-evening to you, mistress; I hope
your cooking is as good as it smells, for I am
well toward being famished.&#8221;</p>

<p>He knocked some clogging particles from
his heels with the stock of his riding whip;
and as he was doing so, he noted with surprise
that his cheery greeting was not replied to.
He had stopped at the inn upon frequent occasions,
and was known to the landlady;
never before had she failed to bid him welcome.</p>

<p>So glancing up, he was about to say something
more, when he noticed that her face was
pale, and that she was trembling with anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so, landlady,&#8221; said a voice, &#8220;I may
have no supper, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may have supper, sir,&#8221; said the
woman. &#8220;You have but to conduct yourself
in a fitting manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>The person whom she addressed was a huge,
loose-jointed fellow with long black hair as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
straight as that of an Indian, and attired in a
soiled traveling costume. He had sharp, ratty
black eyes and a wide, thin-lipped mouth. His
grin at the landlady&#8217;s words showed a row of
yellowed teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Conduct myself in a fitting manner,&#8221; said
he; &#8220;why, mistress, you asking that is like
demanding that the fire be warm or the
breeze be cool. I always so conduct myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you do it now is all I ask,&#8221; said the
landlady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then serve my supper, which I see upon
the coals; it seems to be done to a nicety, and
I am rarely hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Again I tell you that these,&#8221; and the landlady
pointed to the saucepans bubbling away
in the fireplace, &#8220;belong to those who came
before you. It is the rule of the inn to serve
its patrons in turn; and I do not intend to
break my rules at this late day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I assure you, good mistress, that I am
one who has very little respect for rules of
whatsoever description,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;A
supper I want, and a supper I will have, and
that speedily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a young lady, I tell you,&#8221; said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
hostess; &#8220;and with her is a weak old man,
her father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Young ladies have no business upon the
road in these times,&#8221; said the fellow, his yellowed
teeth well displayed. &#8220;And as for weak
old men, better for them if they stopped at
home at all times.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben crossed the room and stood by the fireplace,
his back to the blaze; the night was
cold, and the heat was comforting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better, indeed,&#8221; said the landlady, &#8220;when
they must be interfered with by such as
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep a civil tongue in your head,&#8221; said
the man, and his yellow smile grew particularly
evil; his narrow eyes sparkled with
anger, and his great, bony hands grasped the
arms of his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are few, if any, that can say that I
ever treated them uncivilly,&#8221; maintained the
landlady, &#8220;and if my words are at all severe,
it is your own fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have had a-plenty of words,&#8221; growled
the man; &#8220;a-plenty, good lady, and we&#8217;ll
have no more. A supper I want at once, and
a supper I will have, so have some of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
kitchen folk serve it to me, or upon my soul I
will serve it myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>As the landlady said nothing, the man with
the yellow teeth arose; and as he did so a
door leading to an inner room opened and a
young girl appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father is quite comfortable now,&#8221; she
said to the landlady. &#8220;Thanks to your kindness
in so looking after us,&#8221; she added, with a
grateful look and smile. &#8220;He says he would
like to eat something if it is quite ready; and
that is a very encouraging sign, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His supper is just right,&#8221; said the landlady,
her lips set firmly together, as she gave
the insistent guest a defiant look. She had
crossed about half the room when he stepped
before her. To avoid him she moved aside;
then his huge hand closed upon her arm; and
startled, she uttered a smothered shriek. At
this there came a feeble answering cry; in
the doorway where the girl had appeared,
stood a tottering old gentleman in a dressing
gown and supporting himself by means of a
stick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daughter,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;Betsy, my dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, father,&#8221; and the girl ran to him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>&#8220;I thought I heard you cry out,&#8221; said the
old man. &#8220;And I came to your assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man with the yellow smile laughed
loudly at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for you, old rooster,&#8221; said he, highly
entertained. &#8220;You are a game one, but over
old to be of use. And now, mistress,&#8221; to the
landlady, &#8220;will you out of my way while I
see to my boiled mutton?&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave her a fling at which she cried out
once more. The old man tottered forward,
his stick grasped in one quavering hand. But
his dim old eyes flashed for all his feebleness,
and he cried out bravely:</p>

<p>&#8220;What, sir! and would you lift a hand to
a woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man showed his yellow teeth, much as
a dog might have done.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old sir,&#8221; he warned, &#8220;meddle not where
you have no acquaintance. As for the woman,
I&#8217;d never laid a hand on her had she not been
so stubborn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d eat your supper, sir, that&#8217;s what he&#8217;d
do,&#8221; sobbed the landlady. &#8220;The hungry
wretch cares for no one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right there, mistress,&#8221; jeered the man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
&#8220;I do not, indeed. And to show that I do
not, here&#8217;s for the saucepans, for I can withstand
the temptations of their smell no
longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he strode, with mouth agrin,
toward the fireplace; the old man waved his
stick feebly but was thrust aside with no
gentle hand; and then the fellow came face to
face with Ben Cooper.</p>

<p>Pale-faced landladies, slim young girls and
tottering old men seemed of the sort that had
no power to stop him; and now he leered at
the round-faced stripling with the fresh cheeks
of a schoolboy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you are there, are you, my lad?&#8221;
said he, with enjoyment plain in his voice.</p>

<p>Ben looked at him quietly and nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he; &#8220;here I am, and here I have
been for some time. Indeed,&#8221; thoughtfully,
&#8220;I think I came during the first discussion
with regard to the rights of the earlier
patron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, did you so!&#8221; The man waved him
aside with one huge hand. &#8220;Well, you have
been there long enough. Stand aside.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the lad did not move; a wicked look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
came into the ratty eyes, and again the huge
hand waved him away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Belike you&#8217;ll have me do more than wave
with the hand,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give
you a moment to choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben at once stepped aside, giving the ruffian
a clear way to the fireplace. With the yellow
grin wide upon his face, the man stooped to
lift the bubbling saucepans from the fire. But
before he could so much as touch them, something
beat a sharp rat-tat-tat upon his head;
leaping up, he found Ben regarding him
calmly, a pistol in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem in haste, sir,&#8221; said the boy, as
he trifled with the lock of his weapon carelessly.
&#8220;It may be that the use of a pistol
barrel to drive an idea into your head is not
to your liking.&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant the man was taken aback,
but he quickly recovered his poise.</p>

<p>&#8220;So they have taken to entrusting children
with firearms?&#8221; sneered he. &#8220;It is a thing
of which I can&#8217;t say I approve; and so, lad, I
bid you to put that toy down, or I shall be
compelled to assume your father&#8217;s place, and
take a cudgel to you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s a cold night,&#8221; said the youth, &#8220;but I
fancy that you can bear the cold much better
than we can your company.&#8221; The pistol
barrel indicated the door. &#8220;So go at once,
and let us have no further waste of words.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man saw that his attitude of disbelief
in the boy would be of no use; and so with
an evil look, he crossed the floor and threw
open the door. Then he halted.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is not the first time that I&#8217;ve seen
you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I make no mistake in you,
because you were carefully pointed out to me
by a gentleman who has,&#8221; here the yellow
smile was most manifest, &#8220;your future much
in mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Ben, quietly, &#8220;is very thoughtful
of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay; and he&#8217;ll continue to be thoughtful,
unless I am much mistaken in him. He is a
man who, when he once becomes interested in
any one, seldom lets him slip his mind. And
in your case,&#8221; the man gestured admiringly,
&#8220;he has gone so far as to provide against his
forgetting. He has desired me to also remember
you; and you may depend,&#8221; with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
laugh that made the good landlady shudder,
&#8220;that no matter what he may do, I shall not
forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that the door slapped to, and the
man was gone.</p>

<small>IN WHICH THE HOSTLER SEES TWO SHADOWS IN<br />
THE ROAD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a complete silence for a moment
after the man had gone; then the landlady
spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of all the knaves that ever turned a
decent inn topsyturvy, that one is the worst.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old gentleman approached Ben, his
stick thumping the floor with each step.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young sir,&#8221; said he, in his piping voice,
&#8220;I am thankful to you for the service you
have rendered us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben nodded his head and smiled in his
usual good-natured way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it is but a trifling thing
to get rid of a rascal of that stripe. They seldom
have the courage they seem to have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; and the old man held up
his thin hand in protest, &#8220;he was a formidable
villain enough. I thank you, and my
daughter thanks you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>Here the girl came forward a step or two.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do thank you,&#8221; she said, sweetly; &#8220;I
was in great fear of the man, for he seemed
capable of anything.&#8221; Then as she saw Ben
was of a mind to still make light of the matter,
she added, laughingly, &#8220;Well, at any
rate you have saved our boiled mutton and
the rest of the things; and even though you
persist in refusing our thanks, perhaps you
will not refuse to accept a part of our supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my dear, that was well thought of,&#8221;
quavered the old gentleman, very well pleased.
&#8220;No doubt, young sir,&#8221; to Ben, &#8220;you have
ridden a long way and are both worn and
hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can answer &#8216;yes&#8217; to the latter part,&#8221;
laughed Ben, as he helped the landlady to set
aside the saucepans, &#8220;but I am not over tired,
as I have ridden but from Princeton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From Princeton, did you say?&#8221; The old
gentleman was very eager. &#8220;Then, perhaps,
you came by way of Trenton and saw the army
encamped?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I avoided Trenton as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
as I could. Lord Cornwallis is not in great
good humor just now, and I did not care to
fall into the hands of any of his people.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old gentleman grasped the arm of a
chair, and then sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cornwallis in Trenton! Surely you are
mistaken,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Why, General Washington
is there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was there,&#8221; corrected Ben, &#8220;but now
he is at Morristown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been a battle!&#8221; cried the girl.
&#8220;And we have been defeated.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man tried to rise out of the chair
but fell back.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That cannot be. If
there was a battle, we were victorious!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that you are right,&#8221; said Ben.</p>

<p>Thereupon, he related what had happened;
the three listened breathless; and when he
had done, they were filled with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s glorious!&#8221; cried the girl, her face
flushed, her eyes shining.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, will the Hessians murder honest
people in their beds!&#8221; said the landlady, her
chin up and her arms akimbo. &#8220;We&#8217;ll match
them yet, never fear.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>The old gentleman reached out until his
hand rested upon the boy&#8217;s sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are of the army?&#8221; he asked, very
quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Ben, &#8220;a courier and scout
attached to the service of General Washington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are so many young officers,&#8221; said
the old man, &#8220;that it is not likely that you
have met with Lieutenant Claflin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben pondered a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is in General Cadwallader&#8217;s brigade,&#8221;
spoke the girl, her tone now as low as that of
her father. &#8220;A fair-haired young man, not
over large, but strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Claflin,&#8221; said Ben, thoughtfully. &#8220;Oh,
yes, I recall him; he seems to be much thought
of by General Cadwallader. I saw them riding
side by side in the midst of the Pennsylvanians
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After the battle?&#8221; The question was
asked by the old gentleman and his daughter
at the same instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, to be sure. The army was
then well beyond Kingston, making for the
hills.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>The old man cast his eyes upward, fervently;
the girl put her arms about his
neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;what did
I tell you? He is safe; perfectly safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a few moments the old gentleman
looked at the boy, who was talking in low
tones with the landlady.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is my only son,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;and I
have been much put out by thoughts of his
safety. Indeed, I am now on my way to the
camp. I felt that there must soon be a battle,
and I desired to see him once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>They talked, while the landlady laid the
table at the fire with her whitest linen and
most shining delft.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Joseph Claflin,&#8221; said the old
man. &#8220;I once manufactured iron-mongery
of many kinds, but am long since retired.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben glanced at him, surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the Joseph Claflin whose foundry is
still on the Wissahickon, just above Weiss&#8217;s
Mill?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hah, you know the place then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to, sir, seeing that I was born at
no great distance from it. My name is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
Cooper, and my father&#8217;s place is near to the
Mennonite Meeting House.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Attorney Cooper&#8217;s son! Are you, indeed?
Let me shake your hand.&#8221; The old hands
grasped the young ones in a quavering grip.
&#8220;Why, I have known him these many years;
yes, I knew him when he was not greatly
older than yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so when they sat down to the smoking
supper by the crackling fire they had many
topics in common for discussion. The Claflins
now resided in the city proper; but they
knew Germantown still, and, so it seemed,
frequently visited there.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Mr. Claflin, &#8220;you must call
upon us when you get to Philadelphia and
have some spare time; our house is on Sassafras
Street, not far from Crown, and you will
be warmly welcome there at any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Betsy Claflin added her invitation to
that of her father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps, after the rough life of the camp,
we can make you comfortable if even for only
a few hours,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So please do not
fail, if you have the chance, to drop in on us
when you are in the city.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>They talked for a long time after supper,
and then Mr. Claflin and his daughter took
their candles and retired to their rooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall see you, of course, in the morning,&#8221;
said the old gentleman, as they were going.
&#8220;We will be astir early, for we desire to start
as soon as may be on the way to the camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>After they had retired, Ben sat for a time
chatting with the landlady. Then, thinking
to go to bed himself, he arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall see to my nag,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and then
get some sleep while I may.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As to the horse,&#8221; replied the hostess, &#8220;you
may rest easy about him. The hostler, while
he isn&#8217;t of much use when hectoring fellows
make trouble in the inn, is an excellent hand
with the cattle; I never had a better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Ben went to the barn, and
there, in the ill light of a lantern suspended
from the rafters, he saw the small hostler
seated upon a heap of grain sacks, reading an
old newspaper. At sight of the lad, the man
folded his paper carefully and laid it away.
For some little time he sat regarding Ben, as
the latter patted his horse and rearranged its
bed; then he spoke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>&#8220;He was a rare bad fellow, wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben turned and looked at him questioningly,
for the man with the yellow smile had
vanished from his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom do you mean?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said the hostler, his mild eyes
wide open, &#8220;he that was within there a
while ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221; Ben laughed. &#8220;I suppose he
was as bad as may be. But it all depends
upon how you take them. You see it turned
out that he&#8217;ll do no more harm to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not so sure of that,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;There is more goes on of a night on the road
than an honest body generally knows of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben stood leaning against his nag, looking
at the hostler. The dim rays of light fell
upon the man with weird effect; his pale
skin, light eyes and reddish hair gave him a
most peculiar look.</p>

<p>&#8220;It takes them as are familiar with the
ways of the road after dark to understand it,&#8221;
said the hostler, with a shake of the head.
&#8220;No one else can do it. Strange things happen
when night shuts everything else out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
Deeds are done that would make one shudder
in the sunlight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are one, I take it&mdash;from your talk,
who is acquainted with the road after nightfall,&#8221;
said Ben.</p>

<p>The man nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I am, though I don&#8217;t
just know why I should be, as I have no liking
for such things and am afraid of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not always master of the things
that come to us,&#8221; said the lad. &#8220;Perhaps it
is not best that we should be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be so,&#8221; said the hostler. &#8220;But I
for one cannot understand it. If I were big
of body and had an enterprising mind, I might
be able to come to hand grips with some of
the people I take note of. But, as it stands, I
am neither, and so must content myself with
listening and looking and shaking my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How does one come to be acquainted with
the road after dark?&#8221; asked Ben, curiously.
&#8220;I have traveled it many times at all hours,
and the night hours have seemed much the
same as the others to me, except that the
going was more difficult.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>&#8220;The secret of the night road does not come
to one who travels it merely,&#8221; said the hostler,
wisely. &#8220;No, no. To get at the heart of it,
one must study it, one must lie by its side,
staring at it; one must listen to the slightest
murmur that stirs it, the smallest thing, the
faintest whisper, the tiniest throb of life. He
must have eyes that can pierce the darkness
and ears that can catch sounds a great way off.
And not only must he do all this, but he
must be able to understand what he sees and
hears and feels.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_118.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;YOU SAW SOMETHING THEN?&#8221;</i></p>

<p>The speaker arose from the grain sacks,
went to the barn window and looked cautiously
out. Then he came close to Ben, and
continued in a low voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had not been able to do all this, how
could I have understood what I saw to-night
as I came from the mill, a mile beyond the
turnpike road?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw something, then?&#8221; said Ben.
The lad thought the man, from his queer
words, must be slightly demented; but, for
all, there was an earnestness about him which
compelled attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;I not only saw, but I heard,&#8221; said the
hostler in the same low tone. &#8220;You see, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
miller holds some grain belonging to the inn
to be ground when wanted. And so to-night,
after you had driven the bully away, I went
to the mill to tell the miller that we&#8217;d need
more rye on the morrow. I had not reached
the main road on the way back, when I saw
a thin shadow moving in the lighter shadows
of the road; and as I stopped to watch it, I saw
a second shadow move out and join the first.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man paused here, and one of his hands
touched Ben upon the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was here that my knowledge of the
night road was of service. One who knew
naught of its secrets would have seen nothing
of this, or if they had chanced to see, would
have considered it of no moment. But I understood&mdash;the
shadows could be nothing less
than men&mdash;men who had met together for
some purpose which, perhaps, was not of the
best.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; proceeded the hostler, &#8220;knowing
this, I must know more. They had paused,
had the shadows, and it was an easy matter to
approach them. There they stood by the
roadside, close together, and their voices came
clearly to my ears.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>&#8220;&#8216;And,&#8217; said one of them, &#8216;you thought it
well to keep me prowling up and down in the
cold while you had your supper?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It was no fault of my own,&#8217; said the second.
&#8216;I hurried the best I could. Indeed, if
I had waited until they cooked a supper for
me, I would have waited until midnight. As
it was, I tried to come by that belonging to
another, knowing you&#8217;d be awaiting me; and
I failed even in that.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben drew in a breath long with interest;
the speaker went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;The other man laughed. &#8216;And so you
have come out upon the venture with an empty
stomach?&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have,&#8217; replied the other, &#8216;and all because
of a particular friend of yours who entered
the inn while I was negotiating the meal.&#8217;
At this saying the other seemed puzzled; and
the man had to enlighten him. &#8216;A close
friend of yours,&#8217; said he, &#8216;and one of whom
you spoke with some interest to me not many
hours ago.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Ben Cooper, softly. &#8220;And what
did he say to that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was fair astonished, it seemed to me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
I saw the shadows spring apart, and I saw a
movement as though the man had taken out
a firearm.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ah,&#8217; said he, &#8216;and so he is there! Well,
that is a stroke of good fortune that I did not
expect. Back you go to this inn, and I with
you; we&#8217;ll see to this friend of mine at
once.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An earnest fellow,&#8221; said Ben, quietly.
&#8220;He would be about his business without
delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the other checked him,&#8221; spoke the
hostler; &#8220;it would seem that there was other
and more pressing work toward. &#8216;Don&#8217;t forget,&#8217;
said he, &#8216;that the hours are passing; and
while we are meddling about an inn, wasting
time with a boy, the carriage may pass.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The carriage?&#8221; said Ben Cooper, and a
startled look came into his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The carriage may pass,&#8217; were his words,&#8221;
said the hostler. &#8220;And without another instant&#8217;s
delay the two started off toward the
main road, and I saw nothing more of
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben remained looking at the man for a
space; then he asked:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what direction they took,
then, when they reached the main road?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I lost sight of them in the by-road,&#8221; said
the hostler; &#8220;but,&#8221; with some pride, &#8220;I can
tell you which way they took for all that.
My ears made out that they took to the southward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A carriage from the direction of Philadelphia,&#8221;
muttered the boy as he crossed the
yard to the inn with hasty steps. &#8220;And being
waited for by a gentleman who is much interested
in having harm befall myself. I think,&#8221;
as he pushed open the door, &#8220;this is a matter
which will bear some little examination.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>SHOWS HOW BEN COOPER WENT FORTH INTO THE<br />
NIGHT AND WHAT DISCOVERY HE MADE<br />
BY THE WAYSIDE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ben Cooper</span> had left his holster pistols slung
from the back of a chair in the public room;
so now when he strode in, took them up and
looked at their locks and primings, the good
landlady of the inn opened her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What now?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Has anything
gone wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; answered Ben; &#8220;but,&#8221; smiling,
&#8220;there is no knowing, according to your hostler,
what will befall on the road after night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pay no attention to what he says upon that
point!&#8221; exclaimed the woman. &#8220;He is fair
mad about it. If he can get any one to listen
to his talk about the road, especially the road
after dark, he&#8217;s happy. Pay no attention to
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It so chances,&#8221; said Ben, &#8220;that I am
much struck by something which he has said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
and have the curiosity to look further into it.&#8221;
He placed the pistols in his belt, and provided
himself with ammunition. &#8220;I shall, perhaps,
be gone some time. If I return after you are
all abed, I will not arouse you, so have no
fear upon that score. There is hay in the barn
loft, I know, and I can make myself comfortable
enough in that for a few hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>The landlady was still expostulating when
he departed, and as he walked down the ice-bound
road, he heard her calling shrilly to
the hostler.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in for a rare, good drubbing,&#8221; laughed
Ben, to himself. &#8220;The hostess is a famous
scold when she is herself, as I&#8217;ve often heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>The night was dark and bitterly cold, and
the lad drew his greatcoat well about him,
and plunged his hands deep into his pockets.</p>

<p>&#8220;By all appearances, the carriage is to be
met hereabouts,&#8221; he mused, as he stumbled
along. &#8220;As they have no horses, it seems
reasonable to think that this is so. Therefore,
I must be as cautious as I can, for there is no
telling where these two worthies may be lurking.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wind lifted as he went along and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
soon he felt damp particles of snow upon his
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;A storm,&#8221; said Ben. &#8220;I trust it will not
block the road, if it prove that I must go on
to Philadelphia.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fall increased; and the wind took up
the flakes, whirling them about madly. In a
very short time the night began to lighten,
for the snow clung to the trees and bush and
so mantled the earth as to make things rather
plain to be seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must be more careful than ever now,&#8221;
Ben told himself, his eyes sharply ahead. &#8220;If
they should chance to be hiding near the road
I am sure to be observed.&#8221;</p>

<p>To prevent this he left the road and began
making his way through a thin growth of
tall pines. The ground was thick with a
carpet of needles, over which lay the light
snow, so his footsteps were soft and cat-like.
Suddenly ahead there loomed a sort of barrier
of boughs, and from behind it came the faint
sparkle of fire.</p>

<p>With increased caution the boy advanced,
and as he drew near to the boughs, he caught
the murmur of a voice. The sound continued,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
and Ben fancied that it must be some persons
engaged in conversation; but upon approaching
the sound he was astonished to discover
that it was some one singing.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Oh, ye Irish lads of fair renown,</div>
<div class="verse">Come listen unto me,</div>
<div class="verse">And I&#8217;ll relate a bitter fate</div>
<div class="verse">That happened on the sea.</div>
<div class="verse">It was in the dark December</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the Baltic coast&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Just what happened upon the Baltic coast
is something of a mystery, for at that point
the singing broke off and a voice was raised in
lamentation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, by this and by that,&#8221; it said, &#8220;is there
ne&#8217;er a stick of dry wood in all America to
keep a poor gossoon from freezing to the marrow?
Faith, here I am with sorra the coat to
me back, and the wind whistlin&#8217; a jig tune
about me two ears. Oh, worra, worra, why
didn&#8217;t they leave me stop at home in Ireland
where I was happy, and not bring me to this
place to fight the poor people who only ax the
right to live dacently.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a little flare cast by the fire, Ben saw a
round-headed, well-built lad, with a shock of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
sandy hair and an honest, comical-looking
face. He was grubbing among the brush for
something to add to his fire, but apparently
all that was not frozen to the ground was wet
by the snow, and he was meeting with but
poor success. However, in spite of this, and
with his teeth chattering, he began to sing
once more.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;&#8217;Twas in the hills of Wicklow</div>

<div class="verse">I, as a child, did play.</div>
<div class="verse">Until one morning in the spring&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>What occurred on this particular morning
must take its place beside the episode of the
Baltic coast; for once more did the singer
stop, and break forth into complaining:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;S&#8217;cure to the dry chip is there anywhere.
Oh, then must I get my death, entirely, in a
strange place and with people all about who
think me a thief of the world because I fought
on the side of the Sassanach? Bless us and
save us! It&#8217;s rather fight against them I
would, any time, than for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point Ben stepped around the barrier
of boughs and into the circle of light cast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
by the fire. The sandy-haired youth leaped
up and seized a cudgel which was lying beside
him; whirling it about his head, he cried
boldly enough:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop where you are, or by this and by
that, you&#8217;ll have this lump of a stick clattering
about the head of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben stood smilingly regarding him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you make your way all the
distance without being found out?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other, seeing that, at least, no immediate
attack was meditated, lowered his bludgeon.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you say?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask you, how did you get so far from
Trenton without being discovered?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From Trenton, is it?&#8221; cautiously. &#8220;And,
sure, who told you I come from Trenton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The clothes you wear,&#8221; said Ben, as he sat
down upon a log. &#8220;You threw the coat away
because it was red; but the other things tell
just as plainly that you are a British soldier.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the cudgel was grasped firmly once
more, and the sandy-haired lad took a step
forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it me that you call such a name?&#8221;
demanded he. &#8220;Is it Paddy Burk that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
call by so disgraceful a title? True for you,
I did wear the red coat, and true again that I
threw it in a ditch&mdash;because I hated it. But
never was I a British soldier. I was an Irish
boy compelled to wear a British soldier&#8217;s
clothes, but never for a minute was I anything
less.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a deserter, then,&#8221; said Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;I left them just as honestly as they enlisted
me. There was I at home, a raw boy,
knowing nothing and listening to the tales
the dragoon sergeant told of foreign parts.
And when he handed me the &#8216;shilling,&#8217; I took
it thinking he only meant to be generous with
me, and never dreaming that it made me a
redcoat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that they do such things,&#8221; said
Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then off they took me,&#8221; lamented
Paddy Burk. &#8220;Off they took me to a big
town and put me on board a ship with dozens
more like me, and over we came to America
as British soldiers&mdash;a thing we never thought
to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were with the army of Cornwallis, I
suppose,&#8221; said Ben.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the other. &#8220;I was with him
till he reached the place where they tried to
cross the bridge, and the Americans drove
them back. It was yesterday, I think. Then
I got a good chance and took leg bail for it
across the river on the ice. And,&#8221; with feeling,
&#8220;here I am wandering about with never
a bite nor sup since then; and it&#8217;s fair weak
with the hunger I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence, then Ben
Cooper spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like the British service, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like it!&#8221; The sandy-haired lad gripped
his cudgel in both hands. &#8220;Sure, and how
could any one with Irish blood in his veins like
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said Ben, &#8220;you&#8217;d prefer that of
America.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cudgel was lowered and an interested
look appeared upon the face of the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is a different thing.
I would have tried to find General Washington&#8217;s
army, but I was afeered to go back across
the river.&#8221; He stared at Ben, anxiously.
&#8220;Maybe now it&#8217;s yourself that could tell me
how to find it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Ben, &#8220;one of the first things
that should be done in your case is to get you
warm and provide you with some food. Then
we can think of the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The face of the Irish boy brightened up
wonderfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrah, then it&#8217;s the great lad ye are!&#8221; he
cried, with admiration. &#8220;Sure, a bite to eat
and a fire with a trifle of heat in it would be
as welcome as the sun in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; proceeded Ben, &#8220;before I can do
anything else, I must first see to a matter
of great importance. As for you,&#8221; and he
pointed in the direction of the road, &#8220;take
that way until you come to an inn, less than
a mile away. Say to the landlady that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the other interrupted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, sure, it would make no matter what
I&#8217;d say to her. It would be all the same, faith.
She&#8217;d up with the broom and drive me away
from the door for a vagabond.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; said Ben, and again he was
interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wherever you do be going,&#8221; said Paddy
Burk, &#8220;let me go with you; and when we
come to a place where there&#8217;s a bit of comfort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
to be had, sure, then, you can speak for me
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seeing that the lad was fixed in his belief
that no one would receive him if his plea were
unsupported, Ben&#8217;s mind was instantly made
up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, then,&#8221; said he, arising, &#8220;and make
yourself ready for a little adventure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Paddy Burk, and he passed his
hand lovingly over the length of his stout
club, &#8220;that would be another name for a
&#8216;ruction,&#8217; I&#8217;m thinking. Well, by this and by
that, when there&#8217;s such to the fore, no one ever
saw Paddy Burk stand back and look on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps, Paddy,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you&#8217;ll get your
fill of &#8216;ructions,&#8217; as you call them; for there
is something ahead which promises well in
that direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few moments they had put out the fire
and were trudging away under the trees,
the wind whirling the snow about their faces
and into their eyes. Ben kept his bearings
and never allowed himself to get far from the
road; indeed, he skirted it very closely, his
companion trudging along at his side.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>Suddenly the latter said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whist! What is that beyant there? Is
it a house, I dunno, or is it somebody carrying
a light?&#8221;</p>

<p>At almost the same moment Ben had perceived
the dim spark through the falling snow.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is moving,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and that shows
that it is a light that is being carried.&#8221; They
paused for a time and watched the spark.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is slowly growing brighter,&#8221; commented
Ben, &#8220;and that proves that it is coming
toward us.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little more observation showed that the
light must be upon the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many&#8217;s the time I&#8217;ve seen the lights
coming on that way on the night before
market day at Ballysampson,&#8221; said Paddy
Burk. &#8220;They&#8217;d move a weeny bit this way,
and a small bit that way, according to the
turns in the road, and all the time they&#8217;d be
a-blinking like a one-eyed dragon out of a
fairy book.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben, with a sharp intaking of the breath,
drew out his pistols. The other perceived the
action in the dim light thrown up by the
snow.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>&#8220;Ah, ha,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and so here is where
the ruction starts. Well,&#8221; with a brisk whirl
of his cudgel, &#8220;the sooner the better, for a
trifle of exercise would warm me, so it
would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The first point I must warn you on is to
keep silence,&#8221; said Ben, one hand uplifted.
&#8220;A wagon or carriage is expected at any time,
bearing matters of moment for the American
camp. I have reason to think that it is to be
stopped near here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you think,&#8221; said Paddy Burk, in a
whisper, &#8220;that this, with the light, may be
the carriage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; replied Ben Cooper. &#8220;But come,
let us make our way to the roadside.&#8221;</p>

<p>They turned at a sharp angle and started
for the road; and as they reached it there
came a sudden shout; a pistol shot rang out,
and the moving lamp came to a stand far
down the snowy road.</p>

<p>With the pistols gripped in his hands, Ben
ran forward; as he neared the halted vehicle,
he saw a man climbing down from a high
seat, and another holding a pistol at his head.
In the snow lay a dark, huddled form, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
over it stood a man in a long greatcoat, his
hands stuffed into his pockets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have mercy, good folk,&#8221; whined the man,
climbing down from the driver&#8217;s seat. &#8220;Take
pity upon one who never did you harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man with the pistol answered with a
brutal kick, at which the other howled loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now hold your tongue, or you&#8217;ll get worse
than that,&#8221; said the man with the pistol.</p>

<p>&#8220;The money is here&mdash;safe in the bags,&#8221;
cried the coward. &#8220;Don&#8217;t harm me and I
will show you where to find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was creeping toward the carriage once
more when Ben Cooper&#8217;s first pistol exploded,
and missed. The man who had kicked the
driver whirled about savagely, but the second
pistol laid him low; then the youth dropped
both empty weapons in the road and leaped
for the man in the greatcoat.</p>

<p>This person, however, stepped back, so as to
avoid the full force of the rush; then he lifted
an empty pistol which he held in his hand,
and dropped it skilfully upon the boy&#8217;s head.
Ben staggered beneath the shock of the
blow; the pistol lifted to repeat, but the lad,
shaken though he was, dodged, and in another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
instant had seized the other round the
body.</p>

<p>The man in the greatcoat was powerfully
made, and did not hesitate to grapple with his
foe; but in spite of his great strength he found
in the boy a supple, eel-like quality that made
him difficult to master. Then to make matters
worse for him, he stumbled over the prostrate
form in the road and went down with the boy
upon him. In an instant Ben had planted a
knee in his chest, and gripped him about the
throat.</p>

<p>All this had taken but a moment; and as
Ben clung to his antagonist he felt a glow of
triumph. But in this he was premature, for
just then the man who had gone down under
his pistol shot arose to his feet, the blood
streaming from a wound in his scalp, and
lurched toward the boy. It would have gone
hard with the latter had not fortune favored
him that night. Cramped by the cold and
weakened by hunger, Paddy Burk had labored
along a score or more paces in the rear. But
now, as the newly arisen man was dragging
Ben Cooper from the one he held pinned to
the ground, the Irish lad was upon him with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
a whoop; the cudgel twirled gaily and the
man dropped to the road once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up on the seat with you,&#8221; directed Paddy,
glaring at the driver.</p>

<p>But the speaker&#8217;s face looked so distorted
in the dim lantern light that the
driver was stricken with fear and could not
move.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll up for you,&#8221; said Paddy,
promptly. &#8220;Inside with you,&#8221; to Ben, who
stood still dazed from the blow he had received;
&#8220;and as for you,&#8221; pointing his bludgeon
at the man with the greatcoat, who was
scrambling out of the snow, &#8220;keep your distance,
or by this and by that, I&#8217;ll give you a
taste of the stick that you&#8217;ll not like.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he leaped upon the seat of the
vehicle, and grasped the reins; Ben, after a
bewildered glance within that showed him a
heap of canvas bags snugly tucked away in
a corner, stumbled in and dropped upon a
seat. Then with a yell at the now plunging
horses, the Irish lad waved his cudgel above
his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Away with you, my beauties,&#8221; he cried;
&#8220;sure it is mesilf that will give you a loose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
rein all the way to General Washington&#8217;s
camp if need be.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so away they tore with their precious
load, the lantern swaying madly, the carriage
pitching from side to side.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>DEALS WITH THE ARRIVAL OF GILBERT MOTIER,<br />
MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dawn was well past when Ben Cooper
and Paddy Burk dashed up before the Freemasons
Tavern at Morristown in the carriage
containing the fifty thousand dollars in silver
and gold coin sent by Robert Morris. Word
was at once carried to the commander-in-chief
by the officer in charge; then the bags were
carried into the building and placed safely
under guard.</p>

<p>General Washington was at breakfast some
hours later when Ben and the Irish lad were
sent in, in response to his request. He received
Ben kindly and thanked him with the
utmost warmth for his gallant conduct. The
lad, when given the opportunity, told Paddy
Burk&#8217;s story as to how he was impressed into
the British army, of his desertion, and of his
rare courage in the rescue of the money bags.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it had not been for him, Your Excellency,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
said young Cooper, &#8220;all that I attempted
would have gone for nothing. He&#8217;s
one of the bravest fellows I ever saw, and,&#8221;
eagerly, &#8220;he would like to join with us against
the British.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paddy&#8217;s hand went to his forelock by way
of salute.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like as if I were playing the traitor
to them, your honor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For
sorra the one of them had any right to me;
they got me by deception, and if I made away
from them by the same means, small blame to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The commander smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you desire to join with us?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, if you please, your honor&mdash;that is, if
I can join the troop that Misther Cooper is
with, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say it can be arranged,&#8221; smiled the
general. &#8220;You seem to be of the character
needed for a scout and courier.&#8221; He turned
to an officer near by. &#8220;Attend to this, Harrison,
if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>The general&#8217;s secretary accordingly led the
Irish lad out of the inn; and before long he
was duly added to the scouts in the service of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
headquarters. Nat Brewster, Ezra and George
Prentiss and the Porcupine took to their new
comrade at once; and his shrewd sayings,
comical manners and quaint songs added to
the good feeling the more they saw of him.</p>

<p>After this there were no large movements
for a long time; Washington established posts
completely across the Jerseys, connecting with
the forts on the Hudson highlands. The temporary
halting place proved to be just the
spot for a winter quarters, and being almost
equally near to Amboy, Brunswick and Newark,
was a most excellent place from which to
carry on a system of forays, raids and other
harassing movements; the hills and dense
forests afforded an almost complete protection
from counter attacks of a serious nature.</p>

<p>Slowly the winter wore on; brilliant exploits
marked it from time to time; the American
troops became a terror to the British,
who were not only driven out of the Jerseys,
but were compelled to keep to one or two very
narrowly defined districts.</p>

<p>The British government was making vast
preparations for the coming campaign in the
spring, however. More Hessians were being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
brought to take the place of those captured at
Trenton. Burgoyne was coming to head a
powerful army which was to invade the country
from Canada; General Howe and his
brother, the admiral, were formulating a
scheme which would give them Philadelphia,
while Sir Henry Clinton spent the time planning
an ascent of the Hudson and a blow at
the Highland forts. If these latter could be
taken and the stronghold at West Point passed,
Clinton could join his army to that of Burgoyne
and so split the struggling states in two,
neither part of which could lend help to the
other.</p>

<p>When Howe began to show signs of life,
Washington broke up his camp at Morristown,
and took up a position at Middlebrook,
where he would be more in touch with the
movements of that leader. Once Howe tried
to engulf Sullivan at Princeton; again he
endeavored to tempt Washington to try a
general engagement. But in neither of these
did he succeed, and so he began to plan once
more with the admiral for the taking of
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>During this period Ben Cooper saw quite a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
little of Philadelphia life. The business of
the army frequently took him there, and
often he had permission to spend some little
time.</p>

<p>Distinguished foreigners, attracted by the
struggle for independence, were pouring into
the city; public and social circles were besieged
by them; demands, highly preposterous
for the most part, were made by heretofore
unknown persons for commissions; men
who had not been of higher grade than captain
in the armies of Europe now treated
with contempt any suggestion save that which
carried with it the rank, at least, of general of
brigade.</p>

<p>During the early summer Ben was enjoying
a fortnight&#8217;s leave of absence with his father
at Germantown; and one day he received a
letter from Miss Betsy Claflin. He had met
the Claflins frequently since the night at the
inn at Burlington, and had become very intimate
with them all.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are to give a very grand dinner at the
City Tavern,&#8221; wrote Betsy, &#8220;and we are to
have such a number of distinguished people
present that I shall be dreadfully frightened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
I know. And so I shall need all my friends
to give me courage, and feel sure that I can
count upon you for one.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a great deal more to the note,
telling him the names of the notables who
were to grace the feast, not the least among
whom was Washington himself. The time
set was but a few nights off, and Miss Betsy
apologized for the lateness of the invitation
because: &#8220;I had not known but that you
were with the army, otherwise this would
have reached you much sooner.&#8221;</p>

<p>The City Tavern was the fashionable place
of the city at that day, and many splendid
affairs were held between its walls; and so,
when the night arrived, Ben spent a great
deal of time over his toilet, and made his
way with much magnificence to the inn. It
was brilliantly lighted; there appeared to
be candles everywhere; beautifully gowned
ladies and men in striking uniforms, or
the courtly dress of the period, filled the
rooms.</p>

<p>Ben was warmly greeted by Lieutenant
Claflin, Betsy&#8217;s brother, by that young lady
herself and by their father.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>&#8220;Hah, you young rascal,&#8221; quavered the
old gentleman, as he clung to Ben&#8217;s hand.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve just been talking to General Greene,
and I begin to find out about you. Why
have you not told me of your reputation as
a fire-eater, sir; why have I not heard before
of these exploits of yourself and your
friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, General Greene likes his little joke,
sir,&#8221; remonstrated he. &#8220;He loves to make
much of these little matters of experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you rogue, you can&#8217;t deceive me.
You are a hero, sir, that&#8217;s what you are.
And not only General Greene tells me so, but
others as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Miss Betsy and some other young
ladies took Ben in charge and stationing themselves
in an excellent place for observation,
began to point out all the noted figures of the
day, who were as yet unknown to the camp.
A handsome, rather reckless-looking man of
middle size and carrying himself with a swaggering,
dragoon-like air, attracted the attention
of the lad in a very few moments.</p>

<p>&#8220;And who is that?&#8221; he inquired.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s Colonel Conway,&#8221; replied one of the
girls. &#8220;He was born in Ireland, but has lived
most of his life in France.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A very gallant and capable officer, I have
heard,&#8221; remarked another.</p>

<p>&#8220;He may be all you say, but I don&#8217;t care
for him,&#8221; spoke a third. &#8220;There is something
about him which is repelling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the members of Congress do not
find him so,&#8221; said Betsy Claflin, wisely. &#8220;He
has only been in the country a short time,
but already there is quite a movement in his
favor. I have heard it said that there are
some who think of raising him at once to an
important command.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young lady who had first spoken now
turned a cautious look about to note if any
one were paying attention whom she did not
take into her confidence. Her voice was very
low and her manner profoundly secret as she
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray don&#8217;t breathe a word of this to a
living soul, for I had it privately and in strict
confidence. Congress was to make Colonel
Conway a brigadier, but General Washington
interfered, and said that he thought him an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
unsafe man and scarcely to be trusted with an
important command.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an astonished buzz at this, and
then an outbreak of low-voiced chatter. During
this Ben was observing Conway; he, too,
felt repelled by the man&#8217;s swaggering, arrogant
manner, though he had not yet overheard
a word he said. Suddenly, as he
watched he saw a tall man with powerful features
approach the Irish-Frenchman; they
greeted each other eagerly, and as they did so
Ben watched the tall man with eyes full of interested
recognition. After a moment or two
of watching he turned to Betsy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And who is that, so closely engaged with
Colonel Conway?&#8221;</p>

<p>Betsy glanced at the person indicated.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a gentleman from the South,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Savannah, I think, is his town; and
he has been attracted by the Congress and
other things, perhaps, in the city most of the
winter. He is a great friend of Samuel Livingstone,
the merchant. They have known
each other a great while, or at least I think
I&#8217;ve heard it so said. His name is Tobias
Hawkins.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>Ben regarded Tobias Hawkins for a moment
more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Master Samuel Livingstone vouched for
the gentleman, eh?&#8221; he said, musingly.</p>

<p>Betsy looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And why not,
seeing that they are such old friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, why not, indeed?&#8221; said Ben.</p>

<p>For a long time he sat with moody face;
this was unusual for him, for cheerfulness was
his leading characteristic. The girls strove
to arouse him, but he would emerge from his
abstraction only for a moment at a time; the
next would see him with folded arms staring
at the floor, or regarding Master Hawkins with
fixed and speculative eye.</p>

<p>Later in the evening he was chatting with
Lieutenant Claflin, and some others, when he
noted a tall, fine-looking officer go by; and at
his side was Tobias Hawkins, smiling and
genial, and apparently relating some witticism&mdash;for
the officer, as they passed, laughed
gaily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gates is a handsome fellow,&#8221; said a civilian
youth to one of the young officers in the group.
&#8220;And a good-humored one, I think.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>The young officer grimaced.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have served under him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And
I found him good-humored if one played the
jester to him. With the sun shining, give me
Gates; but with an overcast sky, I would prefer
some more stable person.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young civilian looked astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is it possible that General
Gates is not thought highly of in the army?
I take from your tone that you meant that,&#8221;
in hurried explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did mean it,&#8221; smiled the youthful officer.
&#8220;Gates has the military knowledge&mdash;no
one can deny that&mdash;but,&#8221; and the speaker
tapped his forehead with one finger, &#8220;it is
here that he is deficient. He has not the
judgment, the depth, that ability to apply his
knowledge which makes the general.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Claflin laughed, as did some
others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come now, Hungerford,&#8221; said Claflin,
&#8220;don&#8217;t be so severe upon the general. Remember,
he has been engaged in military service
of one sort or another for only thirty years,
while you have worn a sword for as long a
time as six months.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>Again there was a laugh, and young Hungerford
flushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for that,&#8221; said he, frankly enough, &#8220;I
am not passing personal judgment upon General
Gates. I am merely stating what I know
are the opinions of men of experience. Why,
General Washington himself holds him in no
high esteem, for some time ago when Gates
asked for a brigade, he refused to give it to
him, there being others in whom he had more
faith.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben&#8217;s eyes followed the handsome figure of
Gates and that of Tobias Hawkins; and once
more the moody look came into his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can it mean?&#8221; he asked himself.
&#8220;What is this man&#8217;s purpose? He has pushed
himself into the good graces of a rather simple-minded
merchant, and so has gained entry
into the society of the city. And what I
noted on the first night at this very inn has
since been verified. For some reason he then
was eager to know the names of those opposed
to General Washington, and since then all
those with whom I have seen him upon intimate
terms are of that stripe. First, there
was Mifflin, who is noted for his dislike of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
general, then there is Conway, and now Gates.&#8221;
The boy looked down the long room at the
two men and his thoughts went on: &#8220;He has
some reason. His desire must be to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here he was interrupted by a general movement
toward the room where the dinner was
to be served, and he found himself paired with
a dark-haired, bright-eyed girl whose English
pronunciation proved her to be of French
birth. At the table this young lady proved
to be a most diverting companion. She knew
every one and the history of every one.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am at great pains to acquire information,&#8221;
she smilingly told Ben. &#8220;For, you see,
I am keeping a journal in which I write down
every scrap of intelligence. In years to come
it will be a highly-prized book; even scholars
will go to it when they desire a true picture
of these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Listening to her chatter pleased Ben Cooper,
and soon all thought of Tobias Hawkins had
passed out of his mind. Almost across the
table from them were a number of foreigners
who had come to America in search of military
preferment. One of these was manifestly
of German extraction, a grave-faced man of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
middle age; another was a handsome lad of
about Ben&#8217;s own years. The latter was laughing
gaily with those near him and talking in
English, but with a decided French accent.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Ben, &#8220;is a countryman of
yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>His companion shrugged her shoulders,
helplessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;One sees so many countrymen of mine
these days, that it might be thought Congress
intended to officer the American army from
France,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And some of them&mdash;oh,
what preposterous fellows they are! So much
pretense, so much vainglory. It is really
ridiculous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben had his eyes upon the engaging countenance
of the French lad across the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;That one, at least,&#8221; said he, &#8220;has none of
those things.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl nodded her agreement of this.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is very well, indeed,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
have met him, and my father has told me his
family history.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the young Frenchman burst out
in his imperfect English:</p>

<p>&#8220;But such a wonderful country&mdash;so beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
a land. It is well to fight that such a
country should be free. I am lost in admiration
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, sir,&#8221; laughingly protested one of the
ladies, &#8220;you have been here a very short
time, and you can have seen but little of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, madame, there you are mistaken,&#8221;
cried the lad, delightedly. &#8220;I have seen nine
hundred miles of it, my friends and I. Nine
hundred miles did we ride from Georgetown
in South Carolina, where my ship reached
port. Nine hundred miles through a glorious
country; and the sight of it day after day,
madame, made me more determined than ever
to join your army and help fight for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say you know his name and history,&#8221;
said Ben Cooper to the girl at his side. &#8220;Who
and what is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was born in Cavanac, Auvergne,
France,&#8221; said the young lady with affected
solemnity, &#8220;and he is now just nineteen
years of age. His name is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she paused
and affected great concern. &#8220;Do you care to
hear his full name?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Full and complete, so that I may know
the worst at once,&#8221; smiled Ben.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>&#8220;Very well, then. It is Marie Jean Paul
Roch Yves Gilbert Motier, Marquis de Lafayette.
He is enormously rich, has been a
captain of dragoons, and has made very great
sacrifices at home in France that he might
come here and offer his sword to Congress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben regarded the young Frenchman with
increased attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said the American boy, &#8220;here is a
generous and unselfish spirit, indeed. To leave
a great fortune, honors, no doubt&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All that the French king could confer
upon one so young,&#8221; put in the girl. &#8220;But
no, he would have none of it. He had heard
of the struggle here, and asked Mr. Franklin
at Paris for service. After the defeat of Long
Island the Americans had no credit in Europe;
no one believed in them, it seems, and so
Mr. Franklin could secure no ship to carry
the French boy and his friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We are sorry,&#8217; said Franklin, &#8216;but you
will have to await our better fortune.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not so! He could not wait. He
bought a ship of his own and set sail; and here
he is, offering himself to Congress, to fight the
British.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>After dinner the young Marquis and Ben
Cooper were presented to each other, and
when the French lad learned that Ben was
upon active service with Washington he was
delighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot understand,&#8221; said he, &#8220;how
we admire this general of yours in Europe.
The great Frederic of Prussia says that his
strategy stamps him as the world&#8217;s greatest
soldier.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two were still deeply engaged, Ben relating
some camp anecdotes of the commander-in-chief,
to Lafayette&#8217;s vast admiration, when
there was a stir, a rustle, a hum of voices, a
crowding to the front; but neither of the young
men paid any attention; until, after a little, the
voice of old Mr. Claflin said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What, Marquis, I thought you were wild
to meet our general. And here he is and you
have not even so much as a look for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Turning, his face alight, the next moment
Lafayette was face to face with Washington
for the first time, and listening to the calm,
steady voice which he was afterward to hear
so often in the press of battle.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_156.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap2"><i>LAFAYETTE WAS FACE TO FACE<br />
WITH WASHINGTON</i></p>

<p>Soon there was quite a throng about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
two. The fame of the young nobleman, who
so loved freedom that he would give up all
that most men covet in order that he might
cross a sea and strike a blow for a stranger race,
was all about the city. For the most part the
foreigners who offered themselves were professional
soldiers who sought the power and
emoluments of rank. But here was one
wholly different; he already had rank and
fortune; he desired only to serve.</p>

<p>The admiration of Washington was plainly
visible; he applauded this youth for his unselfishness;
he loved him from the first for his
high heart and noble generosity.</p>

<p>But on the outskirts of the throng there was
a little group in which no sympathy for the
meeting seemed to find a place. In this party
Ben saw the cold face of General Mifflin, the
vain, handsome countenance of General Gates,
and the reckless, selfish one of Colonel Conway.
These three gazed at the little scene before
them with eyes totally unresponsive;
they whispered, exchanged looks of unbelief
and smiles which scarcely concealed the sneers
behind them. These things alone aroused
Ben Cooper&#8217;s resentment; but there was a chill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
at his heart, a feeling of vague fear, as he saw
the satisfaction upon the face of the man in
the rear of the three. And that man was
Master Tobias Hawkins.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>SHOWS HOW THE FIGHT AT BRANDYWINE WAS<br />
LOST, AND HOW BEN BORE THE TIDINGS TO<br />
PHILADELPHIA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> made up his mind that nothing
could be gained by seeking to draw Washington
into a trap, General Howe finally decided
upon a plan and embarked his troops. What
he would do was a matter for speculation in the
American army; every one wondered where
the next blow would fall. Thinking that
Philadelphia must be the point aimed at,
Washington once more crossed the Delaware
and took up a position at Germantown.
While here the tidings came that the British
troop ships had entered Chesapeake Bay, and
that Howe&#8217;s army would disembark at the
head of the Elk River.</p>

<p>At this news the Tories in Philadelphia became
overbold, and thinking to put them
down by a display of power, Washington on
the way southward marched his array through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
Front and along Chestnut Streets with bands
playing and colors flying. There were some
twelve thousand of them, while the British,
whom they were advancing to check, numbered
almost twenty thousand, with powerful
artillery.</p>

<p>The Americans marched to Wilmington,
and there entered camp upon some heights
near to the Christiana and the Brandywine.
Heavy parties were sent forward to come in
touch with the enemy and harass his advance
as much as possible. Howe landed his force
at a point seventy miles from Philadelphia,
and almost at once took up his line of march.
The militia and other parties sent out by
Washington rendered this progress much
slower than it would otherwise have been,
and in this way the American commander
was given an opportunity to reconnoiter the
roads and passes and fords.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks,&#8221; said George Prentiss to Ben, &#8220;as
though the general had made up his mind to
risk a battle in the open.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must, if he is to fight at all, I think,&#8221;
said Ben. &#8220;And that he must fight is settled.
Philadelphia, the city where Congress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
meets, must not be allowed to fall without a
blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; spoke Nat Brewster. &#8220;That
would never do, as I look at it. Everything
must be risked at this point; to desert the
city, now that the enemy are approaching it,
would be to lose its confidence forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Talk of this sort ran through the American
force, showing that the rank and file understood
the position in which their officers
stood. And the position was a most critical
one. The great bulk of the army was made
up of raw men, the militia of New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and Delaware; and in no way
was the American force to be compared to the
British&mdash;neither in number, equipment nor
discipline.</p>

<p>At White Clay Creek, General Maxwell&#8217;s
sharpshooters encountered the British vanguard,
and a spirited fight took place, the
sharpshooters falling back, but the invaders
meeting with much the greater loss. At first
Washington selected a position on the east of
Red Clay Creek, on the Philadelphia road;
but he discovered the intention of Sir William
Howe to pass the Brandywine, gain the heights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
to the north of the stream and so cut him off
from Philadelphia; the American army was
put in motion during the night and took possession
of this point.</p>

<p>There were several crossings of the Brandywine
and the best of them was in direct line
with the enemy&#8217;s advance. This was called
Chadd&#8217;s Ford, and here Washington stationed
the main body of his army under Wayne,
Weedon and Muhlenberg. Maxwell&#8217;s riflemen
were also placed at this point, and Wayne&#8217;s
and Proctor&#8217;s artillery were placed upon a hill
commanding the ford. The right wing was
in the care of General Sullivan, Sterling and
Stephen, while the left, mainly militia, was
commanded by General Armstrong.</p>

<p>What seemed to be the main body of the
enemy began an advance on Chadd&#8217;s Ford
early on the morning of September 11th.
Washington rode along the ranks cheering his
men and being cheered in return. The reports
of the rifles of Maxwell&#8217;s men soon began to
be heard across the Brandywine; after a long
time spent in skirmishing, the sharpshooters
themselves were driven across the stream.
The enemy did not attempt to follow, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
their artillery opened, and the American guns
answered promptly.</p>

<p>While this was going on a rider from General
Sullivan&#8217;s command dashed up to headquarters
bearing the news that a heavy body
of troops under Howe was pushing along the
Lancaster road with the intent to cross at one
of the upper fords and turn the American
right flank. Instantly a party of riders were
sent to ascertain the truth of this; then the
Americans determined to cross the creek and
attack those before them, word being sent to
both wings to do likewise. But just as the
movement was begun, word came by a militia
major that there was no enemy in the quarter
Howe was reported to be in, and instantly
Washington halted the troops once more.
Horsemen were scurrying backward and forward&mdash;all
was in suspense. Finally a resident
of the section, Squire Cheyney, came galloping
up, breathless, and with horse covered
with foam; he had come upon the main body
of the British as they were hurrying along on
the east side of the stream; they had fired
upon him, but he had succeeded in reaching
the American lines unhurt.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>&#8220;You must move, General Washington,&#8221; he
cried, &#8220;or you will be surrounded.&#8221;</p>

<p>The horsemen, sent out earlier, now returned,
confirming this. The British main
body, under Cornwallis, was sweeping down
upon the right wing. Without hesitation,
Washington&#8217;s orders were given. Sullivan
was to attack the invaders, Sterling&#8217;s and
Stephen&#8217;s brigades were to support him.
Wayne was to hold Chadd&#8217;s Ford and see to
it that the German Knyphausen did not
cross, while General Greene was to hold his
command ready to dash in wherever needed.</p>

<p>Sullivan followed his orders, but the time
which had elapsed between the warning and
the orders reaching him enabled Cornwallis
to select his own ground. Taken at a complete
disadvantage, the Americans broke on
each wing; the center stood firm, but receiving
the concentrated fire of the enemy, it, too,
gave way. The young Lafayette, who had
begged permission to go where the fight would
be thickest, seeing that the pursuing British
became entangled in the wood, leaped from
his horse and made a gallant attempt to rally
the broken division of Sullivan.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>&#8220;He proves true under the guns of the
enemy,&#8221; spoke Nat Brewster, admiringly.</p>

<p>Ben Cooper paused and wiped away the
perspiration which streamed from his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew he would, the first time I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
Suddenly he stopped and uttered a cry; then
both he and Nat drove spurs to their horses
and raced forward.</p>

<p>As Lafayette strove with the disorganized
rabble of fleeing militia, a mass of British suddenly
appeared, emerging from the wood;
their pieces sent a volley into the fugitives,
and at the discharge Lafayette fell. Side by
side Ben Cooper and the stalwart Nat Brewster
swept forward; as they neared the young
Frenchman they opened a trifle, then bending
simultaneously, their horses slowing, they
lifted him from the ground, swung him across
Nat&#8217;s horse&mdash;turned in the very teeth of the
oncoming British, and sped away.</p>

<p>Washington came up with fresh troops, and
the Americans made a stand upon a hill near
Dilworth; but again they were driven back
with much loss.</p>

<p>Knyphausen, hearing the heavy firing,
which was his signal to move in earnest, made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
a rush to cross Chadd&#8217;s Ford. Wayne&#8217;s and
Proctor&#8217;s artillery began to sound and Maxwell&#8217;s
riflemen picked off the advance. General
Greene was also preparing to oppose the
oncoming German, when Ezra Prentiss rode
up with orders from the commander-in-chief
that he come to the aid of the right wing,
which was in desperate peril.</p>

<p>Without the waste of a moment the division
of Greene was put into motion and never was
there more rapid marching. It is said that
the brigade covered the distance of five miles
in less than fifty minutes. But, for all his
gallant effort, he was too late to prevent defeat.
However, he was well in time to cover
the retreat; with his field pieces well planted
he kept up a steady fire; again and again his
ranks opened to allow the blocks of fugitives
to pass to the rear. It was a spot selected by
Washington the day before as an excellent one
for a stand should the army be driven from its
first position, and right well did it prove his
judgment.</p>

<p>Cornwallis, flushed with success, came on
with the exultation of a victor; he had seen
the Americans running away, and thought in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
the pursuit to deal them a fatal blow. But
Greene with his guns, and Muhlenberg&#8217;s and
Weedon&#8217;s brigades met them fairly and drove
them back repeatedly. Finally the British
became so exhausted that Greene saw his opportunity
and drew off his men in an orderly
manner; and so threatening were his guns, so
desperate the aspect of his grim ranks that the
enemy did not make any effort at pursuit.
Wayne also had kept his opponents back at
the ford; and he, too, now drew off his force
in such perfect order that Knyphausen did
not dare to follow.</p>

<p>With the Chester road so well covered as to
prevent any calamity, Washington, after a
consultation with his generals, wrote a dispatch
giving a full account of the day&#8217;s fortunes
and misfortunes, knowing well that a
horde of panic-stricken runaways would soon
burst into Philadelphia and spread the news
of utter rout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ride with all speed and deliver this to
Mr. Hancock,&#8221; said the general, upon handing
the dispatch to Ben Cooper. &#8220;And do what
you can to stem the tide of false reports that
will be going about.&#8221; Then as Ben saluted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
and gathered up his reins, the commander-in-chief
added anxiously, to General Greene,
&#8220;I trust no disorder arises in the city; there
are, as you know, many who would willingly
take advantage of so rich an opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Ben sped along the Chester road, his
horse pushed its way, in places, through dense
masses of retreating soldiers; the broken
fragments of the army, also field pieces and
baggage wagons were flowing along in one
disorganized stream, all making for Philadelphia.
At Chester, some dozen miles
north of the scene of battle, was a good sized
stream which the fugitives would have to
cross to reach the city. Here young Lafayette
placed a strong guard at the bridge and refused
to permit any one to cross unless properly
armed with an order from some one in authority.</p>

<p>With his leg swathed in bandages showing
where the bullet had struck him, the youthful
Frenchman sat his horse with much difficulty.
However, sit him he did, and gave his orders
like one born to the work, never betraying a
sign of pain. He recognized Ben at once as
he came up and replied to his salute, and inquired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
anxiously as to the complexion of
things at Dilworth.</p>

<p>&#8220;General Greene held them until the
danger was past,&#8221; replied Ben, cheerfully.
&#8220;And it looks now as though the situation
were well in hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; Lafayette said. &#8220;With us there
was fortune at any rate. We lost the battle,
but,&#8221; and he gestured eloquently, &#8220;we are
saved from utter ruin; and another day we
can fight again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben pushed on at top speed; all along the
road he found wagons loaded with household
goods and such like, with excited men, white-faced
women and crying children trudging at
their sides. The news of the defeat had
reached them, also the report that Washington&#8217;s
army had been cut to pieces and was
flying in complete rout before the British.
The lad did his best to steady the men by
crying out to them that Washington was
holding Howe in check.</p>

<p>As he passed into the city he found much
the same state of things; all day the citizens
had gathered in the streets and public squares,
listening to the roar of the cannon which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
came plainly to their ears; and now the
fleeing families grew more numerous; terror
seemed to be in every face. The throngs
recognized Ben in a moment as being one
from the battle-field; they closed around him
demanding tidings.</p>

<p>&#8220;What news?&#8221; called one.</p>

<p>&#8220;How goes the fight?&#8221; demanded another.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s left of the army?&#8221; questioned a
third.</p>

<p>&#8220;How soon will the British be here?&#8221; cried
another.</p>

<p>Ben waved a hand to them&mdash;the hand
which held his dispatches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make way,&#8221; he cried out, repeatedly.
&#8220;Make way for the messenger to Congress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The battle! the battle!&#8221; chorused the
populace. &#8220;What news from the army?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The army was driven back&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; A groan
interrupted the boy. He continued: &#8220;But
the British were repulsed at last. The army
is safe!&#8221;</p>

<p>The more hardy spirits found comfort in
this last; but the greater part lost none of
their fear; the steady stream of fleeing
families still passed along the streets; men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
rushed hither and thither, preparing to depart,
women sobbed and gathered their children
about them.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the mountains,&#8221; was the cry. &#8220;To
the mountains!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben leaped from his horse at the State House
door; but upon inquiry he learned that
Congress was not sitting as he had expected
it to be in such a crisis. It had held a session
that evening and decided to quit the city; the
next meeting of the body was to be held at
Lancaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said the custodian, &#8220;a number of
the members are now at Clark&#8217;s Inn, just
across the way; and I feel sure that you&#8217;ll find
Mr. Hancock there, also.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clark&#8217;s Inn was a quaint and ancient place,
almost as old as the city itself; the doors stood
wide and the light streamed out upon the
stone-paved walk. Within, all was hubbub;
the day&#8217;s misfortunes were, of course, the chief
topic, but the decision of Congress to quit the
city was almost as much discussed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do I call it, sir?&#8221; were the first
words that come to Ben&#8217;s ears as he entered
the inn. &#8220;What do I call it, do you say?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
Why, I call it cowardice, sir, rank cowardice.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker was the stout Master Samuel
Livingstone, whom Ben had met with several
times before. His face was mottled with
excitement, and one fat hand beat the table
before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not cowardice, perhaps,&#8221; said the person
to whom he addressed himself. &#8220;Not cowardice,
exactly, but rather unseemly haste.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is cowardice, sir!&#8221; maintained Master
Livingstone. &#8220;It is just that, and nothing
less! Was it not Congress who brought us
all to the point of resistance to the king?
Was it not, I ask of you? And now that we
have resisted to the extent of all we have,
what does Congress do?&#8221; He paused, and his
great face glowered at the man to whom he
was speaking. &#8220;It deserts us! No sooner
does it hear of the enemy&#8217;s approach to the
city than it deserts us. The moment that the
slightest chance of danger to itself appears, it
flies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the other man held up a warning
finger; bending across the table he said something
in a low tone. Master Livingstone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
grew a little paler in color; his manner took
on a trace of anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hah!&#8221; said he, as his eyes went about the
room, alarmed. &#8220;Yes, yes, you are right.
Perhaps I had best not go too far. I did not
know,&#8221; in a still lower tone, &#8220;that our friends
voted for the removal to Lancaster.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a quiet corner, Ben found John Hancock
and some friends soberly talking over the momentous
happenings of the day. The elegant
Hancock received the boy with the rather
distant formality for which he was known;
and the dispatches were read at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somewhat too late,&#8221; said he, coldly, after
reading the hasty lines to his friends. &#8220;This
matter of there being no immediate danger
will have to be acted upon at Lancaster.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a slight laugh at this, for the remark
was evidently intended as a witticism.</p>

<p>&#8220;At a little distance inland,&#8221; spoke one of
the party, also a member of the Congress, &#8220;we
can be assured of safety. For even our present
commanders will scarcely allow the enemy to
penetrate that far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Washington,&#8221; said Mr. Hancock, &#8220;has
not failed altogether. He has given us victories.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
Remember, sir, with the means at his
hand he cannot win all the time. It is too
much to require of any general.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But action is not too much to require of a
general; it is not too much to ask the commander
of an army that he have some enterprise;
that he take the initiative occasionally,
that he do not always wait until the enemy
advances upon him before he makes a show of
fighting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right! Right!&#8221; came a number of voices.
&#8220;Quite right!&#8221;</p>

<p>But another member, and apparently a
supporter of Washington, here spoke out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you have not properly
considered what Mr. Hancock meant when he
mentioned &#8216;the means at his hand.&#8217;&#8221; The
speaker tapped the table edge with the tip of
one finger and proceeded: &#8220;When one considers
the slender supply of soldiers which
present themselves for service, one might
wonder very properly where an army sufficiently
powerful to cope with England is coming
from. And even the small force which
our general gathers only remains with him a
short time. The term of enlistment is so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
short that scarcely has a regiment reached a
fair state of discipline than it disbands&mdash;and
in this constant recruiting and training, the
personnel of the army never reaches any but
a most indifferent state. And, then, the
money with which the force is to be maintained!&#8221;
here the member looked about him
and smiled. &#8220;What must keep Washington
going for weeks would not cover the requirements
of Howe for days. The supplies are
seldom of sufficient quantity to fill the needs
of our soldiers; the men go barefoot in the
ranks; the able men lack the arms to fight
with, and the sick men have not the medicine
to make them well.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this there arose a chorus of approval and
protest; the gathered members and their
friends entered into the case with spirit and
heat, and in the clamor that followed Ben
heard little more. Having had nothing to
eat since early morning, the lad, for the first
time, began to feel a trifle faint; until this
the excitement had sustained him, but the
need of food was now strongly brought to his
mind. So seating himself in a quiet nook
near to a window at the front of the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
he ordered a dish of eggs with bacon and well
browned bread and other comforting things.
The window was raised a few inches.</p>

<p>When these were placed before him, he fell
to with relish and will, paying little attention
to the high talk going on all about him.</p>

<p>Outside the inn door were several benches
where patrons of the place were accustomed
to sit in pleasant weather, and as Ben gazed
idly out through the window at his elbow he
found himself looking at the back of one of
these, which was so placed; and over the top
of it he saw the crown of a hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some sensible person who quietly takes
the air in spite of the cold weather,&#8221; said Ben.
&#8220;All this clatter and complaining is not
worth listening to, he thinks, and so he will
have none of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had about reached this conclusion, when
he saw a tall figure turn in from the street
toward the inn door. At a glance the lad
recognized Tobias Hawkins; the next moment
the man upon the bench had arisen to greet
the newcomer, and he, in turn, Ben knew, even
in the indifferent light and though his back
was turned, as the man with the yellow smile.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>TELLS HOW BEN COOPER LISTENED TO SOME<br />
ASTONISHING REVELATIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the manner of the men, it was evident
that the coming of Tobias Hawkins was no
surprise to his friend. Indeed, the latter had
been, it was evident, patiently awaiting him;
and now the eagerness in his manner showed
plainly that he attached some importance to
the arrival.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had about given up all hope of you,&#8221;
said the man with the yellow smile, his first
words showing the truth of the lad&#8217;s discernment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said I would reach here as soon after
nine o&#8217;clock as I could. To be sure, it is
somewhat after that; but I could not finish my
business earlier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The hour at which it is finished,&#8221; said the
other, &#8220;does not greatly matter. The question
is, how did you succeed?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tobias Hawkins laughed and in the sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
of that laugh Ben caught something like
triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;Success,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;is so easily won,
that there is no credit in it. But let us go
inside where we can talk quietly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be much better if we remained
where we are,&#8221; said the other, looking about.
&#8220;The inn is filled with madmen, I think.
They can do nothing but rave over the defeat
of Washington and the flight of Congress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hawkins, after a cautious glance about,
seated himself upon the bench. A small cedar
in a tub concealed the window at which Ben
sat; the boy could see only the crowns of the
two hats over the high back of the bench, but
the delighted sound that came from Hawkins
told him that the man was chuckling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Washington&#8217;s defeat,&#8221; repeated Hawkins;
&#8220;ah, what a relief that was! It altered
things all about me. Trenton and Princeton
and the affairs in the Jerseys had set me a
task that I sometimes despaired of, Sugden;
but this one defeat brought all the complainings
to the top again. The victories were
forgotten; the commander had lost a battle,
therefore the commander was incompetent.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>&#8220;A rare good general, this Washington, I
think,&#8221; said Sugden. &#8220;A careful fighter and
one that will last long&mdash;if they allow him?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a laugh with this last, a mocking
sort of laugh which indicated the speaker&#8217;s
disbelief in the possibility.</p>

<p>&#8220;With the goodness or the badness of Mr.
Washington as an officer, we personally have
nothing to do,&#8221; said Hawkins. &#8220;We are paid
to excite disbelief in him; our duty is to have
him supplanted by a weaker man, so let us be
about that, and bother with nothing else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben felt his heart throb heavily at this, and
the blood beat about his temples and roared
in his ears. Here at last was the thing which
he had thought for so long, put plainly into
words. There was a movement on foot to
displace Washington as head of the army;
fearing that its forces would not be equal to
the task of subduing the aroused colonies, the
British government had set about undermining
the one man whose genius they feared in the
field.</p>

<p>&#8220;A conspiracy,&#8221; breathed Ben. &#8220;A conspiracy
conducted by this man Hawkins!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now better than ever did the lad understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
the actions of Tobias Hawkins. As he
thought over all the man&#8217;s doings and sayings
he fancied that they all centered in the one
purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;On New Year&#8217;s Eve, when I first saw him,
he was but newly come to Philadelphia to begin
his plotting; and that faultfinding old
fellow, Livingstone, was just the sort of man
he needed to enable him to make a fair start;
Hawkins knew that he was well connected,
and much too stupid to ever suspect that he
was being used.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conspirators&#8217; eagerness that same night
to learn from Mr. Morris the names of those
persons who were not upon good terms officially
with Washington once more returned
to the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has found out the greater part of them
by now, I suppose,&#8221; thought Ben. &#8220;There is
the adventurer Conway, the vain General
Gates, and the rather calculating Mifflin; he
keeps the company of all three, and each of
them is an enemy of Washington.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s threat that night returned to
Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;He feared that I had discovered his identity,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
he mused. &#8220;And he thought to stop
my revealing what I knew. This man whom
he calls Sugden as much as said so when I
encountered him at Bristol. And the attempt
to rob the carriage of the money sacks sent by
Master Morris, for I now feel sure that Hawkins
was the other party to that, was but another
way of seeking the embarrassment of General
Washington.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hawkins was still chuckling over what were
apparently pleasing thoughts. For a time the
man with the yellow smile said nothing, but
as the other seemed in no hurry to impart
what he knew, he grew impatient.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, &#8220;let us know what you
have to tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause, the chuckling ceased,
and then Hawkins spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a time only last fall when I
considered this work upon which we are now
engaged as impossible. It was Admiral Howe
who first mentioned it to me, I think, and I
openly scouted it. Then Sir Henry Clinton
broached it, and at last General Howe. Each
of them fancied it, and each of them told me
plainly that it was quite in my way.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>Sugden grunted.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were right there; everything in the
line of underground effort is in your way. I
never saw any one who took more naturally
to subterfuge, wriggling through keyholes,
and the gaining of men&#8217;s confidence for his
own ends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tobias Hawkins laughed. This, so it
seemed, he regarded as flattery.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are disposed to think rather well of
any little talent that I may possess, my friend,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;But I paid no attention to either
of the military or naval heroes,&#8221; he proceeded;
&#8220;their sort are seldom very keen in matters
that do not have to do with the movements of
fleets or divisions. However, when Lord
George Germain wrote to me, begging me to
undertake the task&mdash;and mentioning a handsome
sum which the government would be
disposed to pay me should I succeed&mdash;I began
to seriously turn the matter over in my
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, the money,&#8221; said Sugden. &#8220;Germain
knew how to interest you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Tobias Hawkins laughed, in no way
put out by the other man&#8217;s candor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>&#8220;I can always be appealed to by way of my
purse,&#8221; he confessed. &#8220;I find that it&#8217;s much
the better way when all&#8217;s said and done. To
risk all for the honor of one&#8217;s flag is well
enough, perhaps, for some; but to mix a few
gold pieces with the honor makes it ring better
to others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Different minds have different fancies,&#8221;
admitted the man with the yellow smile.
&#8220;But tell me, what ever made them hit upon
the removal of Washington from command as
the best means of weakening the movement
for independence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They knew the man, and they knew that
such as he must sooner or later clash with the
petty people who were about him. Some of
the newer members of Congress are small men;
Washington is a giant; and mean natures
always come to hate one superior to them.
Could I gain the confidence of the small men
in Congress, thought Lord George Germain, I
would have taken a long step toward success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; said Sugden, approvingly.
&#8220;Most excellent!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; went on Tobias Hawkins, &#8220;upon
my own part I knew that there would be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
certain amount of dissatisfaction in the army.
Every captain would want to be a colonel,
and every colonel a general of brigade. These
dissatisfied ones I decided to select as my
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nature of the man&#8217;s plan appalled the
young American; and yet he could not help
but admire its cold-blooded perfection.</p>

<p>&#8220;And there are enough of that sort in the
army for all intents,&#8221; said Sugden. &#8220;It did
not take me long to learn that all who put on
a uniform did not do so through love of country.
Gates, they say,&#8221; and Sugden sniggered,
&#8220;is the very man to bring victory to the
American arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a thing,&#8221; said Hawkins, &#8220;which
fits most excellently into my plan. Gates is a
weak man, all but mad with vanity, and jealous
in every fiber of his being of Washington.
With much hard work I have centered upon
him the favor of all in Congress who are opposed
to the present commander.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they are not aware, I&#8217;ll wager, that it
was your hand that bent them so,&#8221; said the
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;They do not dream of it; each thinks the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
idea began with himself, and I,&#8221; with a laugh,
&#8220;am careful enough to allow them to go on
thinking so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now as to this foreign adventurer, Conway,&#8221;
said Sugden; &#8220;he seems to have advanced
in favor very rapidly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The opposition to Washington took him
up because he dislikes Washington; they are
struck with admiration of his military talents.
I control him by the only means which could
control him. He fancies, through my hints,
that Gates is but a figurehead, and when the
time comes to choose Washington&#8217;s successor,
that he, himself, will be the man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better and better,&#8221; commented the other,
his tongue clicking in admiration. &#8220;You
have lost none of your cunning, I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have heard of the change that has
been made in the commissariat of the army, I
suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, something, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been taken from the hands of those
friendly to Washington. Delays will ensue,
and that will insure a poorly fed, badly
clothed and scantily cared-for following. With
such a rabble, he can do nothing. The result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
will be the growth of the cry &#8216;Give us Gates;
he can save the country!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clever,&#8221; admired the other; &#8220;very clever,
upon my word!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is lucky for us that Gates has succeeded
Schuyler in the north,&#8221; said Hawkins.
&#8220;Schuyler has borne the brunt of the fighting
up there, and when he had so placed the
pieces as to assure success, he was removed
from command, and the favorite sent in his
place to reap the fruits of his labor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well planned,&#8221; said Sugden. &#8220;I cannot
see what is to prevent the entire movement
for liberty, as they call it, from falling like a
house of cards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben Cooper had listened to this conversation
with blood that was slowly heating to a point
where an outbreak of some sort must come.
He did not stop to reason as to what was best
to do, as Nat Brewster or some others of his
friends would have done; but when the impulse
came, he threw up the sash, placed
his hands upon the window sill and vaulted
through. Stalking round the end of the
bench he suddenly confronted the two conspirators.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>&#8220;Perhaps, Master Tobias Hawkins,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;the fall of the cause against which you
have worked so very expertly will not come
as easily as you think. General Washington
is not without friends; and look to yourself
that it is not you, instead of he, that will come
to grief.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment the two men were too astounded
to speak. The position of the bench
upon which they sat, so they had apparently
thought, and the low tones which they had
used, made it impossible that they be overheard.
The window behind them had escaped their
attention entirely. But Hawkins recovered
himself readily enough and regarded the
indignant lad, a sneer upon his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, we meet again,&#8221; said he, in a low,
savage tone. &#8220;It would seem that in the
end we must become more or less intimate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps much more than you will care
for,&#8221; said Ben Cooper. &#8220;Your intentions and
your accomplishments will make you none
too popular with Congress, the army or the
public.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; said Tobias Hawkins, slowly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
&#8220;you would make known what you have
heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the first opportunity,&#8221; said Ben, hotly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said Hawkins, and a disagreeable
smile crept across his face, &#8220;it would be
best for you to raise a hue and cry now.
There are many persons of importance in the
inn; call them, charge me with what you
like!&#8221; His head bent toward the boy and
one finger waved at him mockingly. &#8220;But
who, think you, would believe what you have
said?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben stared at the man, the truth of what he
said coming like a shock.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a gentleman of consequence in the
community,&#8221; smiled Tobias Hawkins, disagreeably,
&#8220;and you are a wild youngster whose
word is not to be too largely credited. I have
friends in the Congress, in the army, in civil
life. Everything that I have done,&#8221; and the
smile grew still more disagreeable, &#8220;has been
done openly and for the good of the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But your reasons,&#8221; flared the boy, &#8220;your
reasons have been to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you prove that?&#8221; questioned Hawkins.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>&#8220;You yourself have said it,&#8221; returned Ben.</p>

<p>The man laughed, and his companion joined
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I deny that I said it,&#8221; spoke Hawkins.
&#8220;And now what do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nonplused, Ben stood for a moment, not
knowing what answer to make. Hawkins
was right. Ben could prove no wrong intention
behind anything the man had done. To
have plotted against Washington was no crime.
Many men in public life were doing the same
thing openly, every day. Now that it was too
late, Ben saw that he had been too impulsive
in making known his presence; but though
defeated, he made up his mind to have a final
fling at any rate.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; said he, evenly enough,
now that he realized the weakness of his
position. &#8220;Just now I can do nothing&mdash;in
that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you see that, do you?&#8221; laughed the
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; replied Ben. &#8220;But there is one
thing which you, seemingly, do not see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is that?&#8221; asked Tobias Hawkins.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>&#8220;The nature of the punishment awaiting
known enemies found within the lines,&#8221; said
the boy, composedly.</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence; then Hawkins,
with a shifting in his bold eyes which
was not there a little before, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is difficult,&#8221; said Ben, &#8220;to recall a face
seen in the press of battle, more especially
when that battle took place so long ago, as did,
we will say, Bunker Hill. But, sometimes, it
can be done; and frequently more than one
person can recall the face. So, in your proceedings,
Master Hawkins, do not be overbold,
I warn you. When one knows a thing, as I
know it, there are many ways of bringing
about a desired end.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that the boy turned about and
entered the inn, leaving the two men staring
after him.</p>

<small>HOW STORM-STAYED GUESTS CAME TO THE INN<br />
AT RISING SUN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> leaving the two conspirators on the
bench before Clark&#8217;s Inn, Ben Cooper entered
the building, sought the landlord and paid his
score.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you do not mean to stop here to-night,&#8221;
said the host, who knew him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Ben. &#8220;It will, perhaps,
be the last time I shall have to pass with
my father in many days, and I think I shall
ride out to Germantown and spend the night
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>His horse, which had been placed in the inn
stable, was brought out; Ben mounted and
struck out north, meaning finally to turn into
the Germantown road. He entered this some
distance beyond the city limits; the night
was moonlit, but there was a haze hanging
over everything which waved from tree and
bush, in the light breeze, like long, gauzy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
streamers of white. He had gone quite some
distance on his way when at length he made
out a peculiar sound, a steady rising and falling,
of which he for a long time could make
nothing. Finally, however, he understood,
and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s some one singing,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The sound was behind him, and coming
through the waving banners of mist, edge-lit
in the moonlight, it produced a weird effect.
He drew in his horse, after a time, in order to
hear the better; away in his mind was the
impression that he had heard the music somewhere
before.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer drew the singer, the fall
of hoofs now mingled with the song; listening,
Ben at last recalled the mournful melody.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is one of the songs sung by Paddy Burk
on the night I met him by the Bristol road.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then amid the clatter of oncoming hoofs
the words of the song became plain.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Oh, ye Irish lads of fair renown,</div>
<div class="verse">Come listen unto me;</div>
<div class="verse">And I&#8217;ll relate a bitter fate</div>
<div class="verse">That happened on the sea;</div>
<div class="verse">It was in the dark December</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the Baltic coast&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>Here the singer&#8217;s horse stumbled, and the
song came to an abrupt termination. Then a
voice was lifted in protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrah, what kind of a beast are you, at
all, at all! Faith, you go stumbling along
like a porpoise in wooden shoes. Lift up
your feet, you good-for-nothing villain, or it&#8217;s
the whip I&#8217;ll be taking to you, though I&#8217;ve
never done it before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amazed, Ben called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;What, Paddy Burk!&#8221;</p>

<p>The horse and rider came to an abrupt stand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is that taking me name into his
mouth?&#8221; demanded the rider, his hand upon
his pistol. &#8220;I see you there, but I can&#8217;t make
you out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Ben Cooper,&#8221; answered the lad.</p>

<p>Instantly the other touched his mount, and
it trotted forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrah, now, here&#8217;s a meeting, indeed,&#8221;
cried Paddy, with a rollicking laugh. &#8220;I
knew you were somewhere ahead of me, but
sorra the sight did I hope to have of you to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how did you come here?&#8221; asked Ben,
puzzled. &#8220;You are about the last person in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
the world I expected to see on the Germantown
road to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; spoke Paddy, humorously,
&#8220;it&#8217;s meself that did not expect to be here,
either. But you see,&#8221; as their nags cantered
ahead side by side, &#8220;I were sent on to Philadelphia,
too, with dispatches; I asked for you at
the inn across from the State House and was
told that you had started for your home.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; says I to myself, &#8216;you&#8217;ve only
been there once, Paddy, my lad, but sure, I
think you can find the way even at night, for
never was there a place where you were made
more welcome.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lonely way, and I&#8217;m glad indeed to
have your company,&#8221; said Ben, for he and the
Irish boy had become the best of friends during
the months of their acquaintance. There
was no more merry soul in all the American
force than Paddy; also, he was a daring rider
and tireless. In the many fights in the Jerseys
he had shown himself fearless and resourceful.
During the day at Brandywine he had been
with Sterling&#8217;s brigade, in the thick of the
early onset, as Ben learned as they rode along.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a great day, entirely,&#8221; declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
Paddy, &#8220;and sorry was I that we couldn&#8217;t win
it. But,&#8221; hopefully, &#8220;there are other days
coming, and our day is among them, somewhere,
I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a little they fell into silence, and the
Irish boy began to take note of the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it is a lonely place, sure
enough. A while ago, as I were coming along,
I felt a bit down in the mouth, and that is
why I took to the singing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been for that, I&#8217;d not have
recognized you,&#8221; said Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, then, that is lucky enough. But,&#8221;
and Paddy looked back over his shoulder, &#8220;it&#8217;s
not all good fortune me singing brought me
to-night. Faith, a while ago it nearly got me
a knock on the head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How was that?&#8221; asked Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I just said, I felt a bit down in the
mouth, and so started a few bars of &#8216;Tatter
Jack Walsh&#8217; by way of a lilt. Never a bit of
attention I was paying to anything, but looked
straight between my horse&#8217;s ears as they stuck
up before me, when lo! and behold you, I hears
a voice almost at my ear, and suddenly sees a
horseman riding on each side of me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>&#8220;What then?&#8221; said Ben, with interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;My hand makes a move for the pistol in
my holster, but before I could reach it one of
the men says:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Keep hands off that. No harm&#8217;s meant
you.&#8217; Then turning to the other he says:
&#8216;I told you that a screech-owl like this would
not be he.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then says the other:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No harm&#8217;s done in making sure. This
is the road he&#8217;d take, and he&#8217;s somewhere
ahead.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hush!&#8217; says the other, and he made as
though to clap his hand over the mouth of the
one that spoke. &#8216;Hush. Not another word!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Ben Cooper, and his eyes also
went back over his shoulder. &#8220;And what did
you do then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I put spurs to my horse,&#8221; replied Paddy,
&#8220;and made away from their companionship
as hard as I could. And I promised myself
as I came along that I&#8217;d warn the person they
were after if I came up with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, Paddy, you&#8217;ve kept your promise,
for unless I am greatly mistaken, I am that
person.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>Paddy uttered a surprised exclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then, look at that,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Faith,
it&#8217;s a thick head I have entirely not to think
of it myself. And so,&#8221; with great concern in
his voice, &#8220;it&#8217;s you they are riding to overtake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said Ben, evading this question,
&#8220;that you did not gain a very good view
of them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not,&#8221; admitted the Irish lad, &#8220;for it
were a part of the road which were overhung
by great trees, and sorra a ray of
moonlight fell upon them. But both of
them were of good size, I could see that, and
they sat their horses like men used to the
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a very little while the two lads reached
a section not far from Germantown known
as Rising Sun; and it was here that Ben&#8217;s
horse, having been hard pressed all the day,
suddenly showed symptoms of lameness. At
a little public house, which showed a glint of
light in one of the windows, they dismounted,
and Paddy thundered at the door. After a
few moments it opened and a man came out,
holding a light above his head. He was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
small man with a lean, crafty face and sharp
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wanted?&#8221; he asked in an angry
tone. &#8220;What&#8217;s this knocking, sirs, at this
time of night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My horse has gone lame,&#8221; said Ben. &#8220;I
want to leave him here to be cared for, and
engage another to finish my journey to Germantown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may leave your horse if you care to,&#8221;
said the man. &#8220;But as for giving you one to
replace it, that is more than we can do. We
have but one, and that&#8217;s in the city to-night,
gone with a load of vegetables.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; said Ben to his companion.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t torture my good beast by
forcing him further.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There seems to be sorra the thing to do
but stop here,&#8221; said Paddy Burk, &#8220;and make
the best of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben also felt that nothing else remained
to do; but somehow he had a feeling that it
would not be well. The idea of the two
riders somewhere along the road came to him
unpleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; he thought, trying to shake the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
feeling off, &#8220;there is more to be feared afoot
in the open road than there is in an honest
public house.&#8221;</p>

<p>He must have spoken the last few words
aloud, for the sharp-faced man held up the
lantern until the rays fell full upon the lad&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you question the inn, sir?&#8221; he demanded,
bristling. &#8220;It has had an honest
name these many years. Drovers, farmers
and all those going into and coming from the
city have had bed and board here; and never
was there one to say that a wrong was done
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say nothing against your house, good
man,&#8221; said Ben. &#8220;For anything to the contrary
I know, it may be the most perfect of
inns.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave his horse to the man, who led it to
the barn. Ben and Paddy followed, and after
stripping the saddle from the animal examined
the leg. Finding that the strain was nothing
serious, they rubbed it well, bound it and saw
that both beasts were fed. Then they went
into the inn.</p>

<p>It was a shabby sort of place, dusty and ill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
kept; but they were so situated that they
could do nothing but make the best of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I get the gentlemen for their
suppers?&#8221; inquired a huge, red-faced woman
as she came rolling from an inner room. &#8220;We
have some excellent ham, and some fowls
well worth the price we ask for them. Try a
pair, roasted, sirs; they are that tender and
young that they&#8217;ll melt in your mouths.&#8221;</p>

<p>But both boys had eaten their evening
meal, and said so.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can give us beds, that&#8217;s all we&#8217;ll
trouble you for,&#8221; said Ben.</p>

<p>There was some grumbling at this between
the man and woman; but finally the former
lighted a candle and nodded for the lads to
follow him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But take care of the stairs,&#8221; he said, as
they ascended a crazy flight of them; &#8220;they
are somewhat old and worn, and we would
not have an accident happen for the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; spoke Paddy Burk, as he
felt, with no little trepidation, the stairs tremble
under his feet, &#8220;if you are as nervous
about it as all that, it&#8217;s queer that you don&#8217;t
repair them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>The man grinned at him over his lean shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t belong to me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We
are tenants of this place, and the owner should
make the repairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>They reached the second floor through a
trap-door and found themselves in a low ceilinged
room with cobwebs hanging from the
rafters and the window-panes smutted and
broken. Two beds of straw were upon the
floor in opposite corners, and the boys looked
at them askance. However, they were accustomed
to much worse in the camp, and so said
nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave the candle with you,&#8221; said the
man as he stood upon the shaky stairs, his
head and shoulders protruding through the
trap. &#8220;We rise early in the morning,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;and I suppose you&#8217;ll want to make
an early start.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ben, &#8220;and if you do not hear
us moving about, landlord, arouse us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man said that he would, lowered the
trap-door and disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;If my horse is not able to travel in the
morning,&#8221; said Ben to Paddy, as they prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
for bed in the dim candle-light, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
have to go on to my father&#8217;s and get another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will require us to be stirring early
then, if we expect to get back to camp at any
reasonable hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid the ride back will be much
shorter than you think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Do you suppose&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That the army is going to fall back? Yes.
And,&#8221; with a sigh, &#8220;it may continue to fall
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Ben stretched himself upon the pallet,
his mind was busy with the consequences that
would attend these constant retreats. The
hands of Washington&#8217;s enemies would be
strengthened; should Gates meet with a success
in the north, he would stand before the
unthinking as the shining military light of
the nation, and Congress might go to the
length of placing him at the head of the army.
The boy&#8217;s knowledge of military tactics was
necessarily limited, but he was aware of the
almost certain fatality that would attach to
this action. The powerful intellect and unshaken
fortitude of Washington replaced by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
the petty vanity of Gates meant but one
thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Destruction,&#8221; muttered Ben. &#8220;Such a
man as General Gates could not sustain a
series of disasters. He would collapse under
discouragement, and the army would melt
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Paddy blew out the candle, and
crawled into bed. As he lay there, a single
spot of light upon the ceiling attracted his attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; said he, and arose upon
one elbow. Ben did likewise, and both stared
at the spot of light. Then they noticed a
thin beam coming up through the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a hole,&#8221; said Paddy Burk. &#8220;They
still have a light below stairs, and it&#8217;s shining
through.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they settled back to sleep, the first heavy
drops of a rainfall set in. The pattering upon
the shingles lulled them into that drowsy
state which comes before deep slumber.
Through the dim avenues of this, Ben had
a consciousness that the rain had greatly increased
and the wind had lifted, and after a
little he became aware that some one was stirring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
without in the road. But in his dreamy
condition the sounds seemed far away. Voices
were heard, but as though they were the
voices of persons in the distance. But the
loud closing of a door aroused him to a more
wakeful condition; heavy footfalls were heard
below, and a voice spoke sharply to the landlord.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you, gentlemen,&#8221; said the latter,
&#8220;I have no more room. The house is a small
one, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll have to accommodate us
somehow, Master Host,&#8221; said a voice which
brought Ben to a sitting position. &#8220;There is
no other place but the &#8216;Waggon&#8217; at Germantown,
and that&#8217;s too far in this weather.
And to return to the city is out of the question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have but the one room for guests, sir,&#8221;
stated the landlord. &#8220;That has but two beds
and they both are occupied.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you that it would be better to continue,&#8221;
said another voice, and at the sound
of this Ben arose. &#8220;We still had a fair chance
to come up with him, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do,&#8221; said the first voice. &#8220;A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
still tongue would be best suited to the occasion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stepping softly across the floor Ben reached
the place where the beam of light shot upward;
through the crevice in the planks he
had a good view of the public room below.</p>

<p>There in the center of the floor stood Tobias
Hawkins, a riding whip in his hand; and
against the chimneypiece leaned the long,
bony form of the man with the yellow smile.</p>

<p>It was the work of an instant to awaken
Paddy Burk. The Irish boy was one of those
who come out of a sleep keen and alert; and
he listened quietly as Ben whispered to him
the necessary particulars as to the men below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrah, then,&#8221; said Paddy, with a yawn,
&#8220;they are the two bla&#8217;guards, entirely.&#8221; He
crept with Ben to the hole in the floor and
surveyed the two below with great interest.
&#8220;And so they are the villains who stopped
the carriage with the money in it,&#8221; he whispered.
&#8220;And to think,&#8221; astonished, &#8220;that
it&#8217;d be the same two whom I met to-night.
Sure the world is a small place, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put our horses up, anyhow,&#8221; said Tobias
Hawkins to the landlord. &#8220;And after you&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
seen them well and fed and littered, awaken
these travelers and inquire of them if they&#8217;d
not share their room with two gentlemen
seeking shelter for the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, as for the matter of that,&#8221; said the
landlord, as though the idea appealed to him,
&#8220;perhaps we might do something in that way,
sirs. You see, the two travelers are but boys,
and they may be prevailed upon to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the two men stopped him with uplifted
hands and forward steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys?&#8221; said Sugden.</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of boys?&#8221; asked Hawkins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, well-grown lads, perhaps of eighteen,&#8221;
replied the sharp-faced landlord. &#8220;They
were on their way north on the road when
one of their horses went lame&mdash;not that of the
Irish one, but the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Irish one,&#8221; said Tobias Hawkins.
&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>The two watchers above saw him exchange
glances with his companion, and they were
glances full of meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;We met the Irish lad on the road,&#8221; said
Sugden, &#8220;but, as it chanced, he was alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From their words in the barn, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
they spoke little, I drew that the Irish one
had overtaken the other on the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As like as not,&#8221; said Tobias Hawkins.
Then he asked: &#8220;Did you perchance ask
their names?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not, but it may be that my wife
did.&#8221; He went to a door in the rear and
opening it called lowly: &#8220;Did you inquire of
the two up-stairs what their names were?&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice of the woman replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But one of them I&#8217;ve seen before.
He&#8217;s the son of Lawyer Cooper who lives at
Germantown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; said Tobias Hawkins, as the
landlord closed the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know him, sir?&#8221; asked the landlord,
curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very slightly,&#8221; said Hawkins, and the
watchers saw the evil smile which he gave his
friend. &#8220;Very slightly; but I am much interested
in him, nevertheless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I go up and see if they will share
the room with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. Put our horses away.&#8221; Hawkins
surveyed the man closely; apparently he
saw something in the lean face and sharp eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
which pleased him, for he laughed, and continued:
&#8220;When you return we shall discuss
their being disturbed or no.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the man left the room, the two
sat down by the table upon which burned the
candle; the eyes of both were turned in the
direction of the room above, and both shook
with silent laughter that was not pleasant to
see.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>SHOWS THE BARGAIN THAT WAS STRUCK BY<br />
TOBIAS HAWKINS AND HIS FRIEND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Ben Cooper and Paddy Burk looked
down through the crevice in the floor, the two
men drew together across the table and began
to speak in tones so low that the boys were
unable to hear their words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith, they look like grinning imps, so
they do,&#8221; commented the Irish lad in a
whisper. &#8220;Sorra another pair like them did
I ever see.&#8221;</p>

<p>For some little time did the two continue to
speak; then the landlord&#8217;s entrance interrupted
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, gentlemen, I am at your bidding in
any way that I can serve you,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Tobias Hawkins regarded him fixedly for a
short time, then he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not a very large place here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We would have a larger if we could,&#8221; said
the man, surlily.</p>

<p>&#8220;But sometimes small places are very well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
patronized,&#8221; and Hawkins looked about the
dingy public room, plainly disbelieving that
such was the case here.</p>

<p>&#8220;The small places you have in mind,&#8221; spoke
the lean-faced landlord, &#8220;are very much unlike
this one, then. We have not enough
patronage to hire a hostler, even though we
are on a highroad to the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the villain told us that he were
patronized by all,&#8221; whispered Paddy Burk,
indignantly. &#8220;Faith, I thought it strange
that he could get so many into one cobwebby
room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben pressed his arm for silence, for Hawkins
was speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will pardon the liberty I take,&#8221; said
the man, &#8220;but I would not say that you were
very well off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you did say so,&#8221; spoke the landlord,
&#8220;you would be saying what had never a grain
of truth in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hawkins laughed; never for a moment did
his hard eyes leave the face of the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is seldom, I suppose,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;that
any one comes along who gives you the opportunity
to lay something by.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>&#8220;They never come,&#8221; declared the man,
sourly. &#8220;For the most part, our patrons are
like those two,&#8221; and his finger pointed upward.
&#8220;Nothing but a lodging; not a crumb did
they eat between them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hawkins clicked his tongue as though
greatly in sympathy with the host.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can make no great progress at that
rate,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man might stay a beggar all his life
if he depended upon such trade,&#8221; spoke
Sugden.</p>

<p>Surprised at so much sympathy, the man
began to make a detailed statement of his
complaint, and was still more surprised that
he was listened to. When he had done, Hawkins
spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it goes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Seldom, indeed, do
we get justice done us. Now you,&#8221; cocking a
knowing eye at the landlord, &#8220;are a fellow
who might make a trifle in other ways beside
innkeeping. The wonder is that you have
not tried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuck here in this place, what can I do?
And nothing ever comes this way that has
any money attached to it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>Hawkins shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are wrong there,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;I dare venture that many a time there&#8217;s been
a goodly sum, only awaiting the earning of it,
right here in this very room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Them as had it kept it mighty close, then,&#8221;
said the landlord.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may not have been that. Who knows
but that it was you who closed your eyes to
the chance? Why, for all you can see, there
may be as much as you&#8217;d earn in a six-month,
here to-night, at your hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence; the lean
claw of the landlord stroked his chin and his
small, sharp eyes looked into those of Tobias
Hawkins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I don&#8217;t take your meaning, sir,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;and then, maybe I do. But I will
say this for myself: If there is such a sum
here to-night that I can be in the way of earning,
why, I&#8217;m the man for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent,&#8221; approved Hawkins. &#8220;I fancied
to hear some such answer from you.&#8221; He
got upon his feet and advanced, switching his
boot-leg with his riding whip, to the chimneypiece
where the landlord stood. &#8220;You look
to be a fellow of good courage&mdash;one not easily
frightened.&#8221;</p>




<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>The man&#8217;s hand now left his chin, and his
glance was swift.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_212.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>THE MAN SHRANK A LITTLE</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I think I begin to understand
you. This money, sir, is how much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirty English sovereigns.&#8221;</p>

<p>The landlord&#8217;s eyes glistened in the candle-light.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good sum, in the common way of
speaking,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But, perhaps,&#8221; shrewdly,
&#8220;none too good for the work to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hawkins bent forward and whispered in
his ear; then his finger pointed upward, as
though indicating something in the room
above. The man shrank a little, and his face
seemed to blanch. But his gaze remained
fixed steadily upon Hawkins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said he, with a deep drawn breath,
&#8220;so it is that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To a man of easy manner and confidence
in himself,&#8221; said Hawkins, &#8220;the thing is no
great matter. The like is done often enough,
I dare be sworn. So what harm if an odd
case or two be added?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To such as that,&#8221; said the landlord, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
the lean hand was again caressing the pointed
chin, &#8220;there is risk attached.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Risk!&#8221; Both Hawkins and Sugden jeered
at the bare notion of such a thing. &#8220;Surely,&#8221;
continued the former, &#8220;you do not fear
two&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the landlord stopped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that, mayhap,&#8221; said he, &#8220;though the
two are more than ordinarily well armed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well,&#8221; sneered Hawkins, &#8220;I see you
are not the man for the money, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; The landlord held up a hand.
&#8220;Just one moment, sirs. What,&#8221; and his lean
face was thrust forward, &#8220;would you have me
do with the two lads?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Deliver them up to us&mdash;nothing more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; The landlord showed vast relief.
&#8220;That is a matter of some difference. However,
my wife is here; if you&#8217;ll but give me a
moment I&#8217;ll speak to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>He crossed to the inner door and called his
wife by name.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is some trifling matter of business
toward,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The gentlemen have
money to pay, if we will but set ourselves to
earn it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>The huge woman rolled from the inner
room with ponderous slowness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Money, did you say?&#8221; she inquired, with
a sharp greed in her tone. &#8220;How much, and
what&#8217;s to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence; then the
landlord spoke slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sum is thirty sovereigns&mdash;golden sovereigns,&#8221;
his lips smacking the last words as
though the taste of the yellow metal was upon
his tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure, golden ones, if they are sovereigns
at all, idiot. Who ever heard of sovereigns
of any lesser metal?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hawkins laughed at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;They will be easily earned,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;And we will pay, money down, the instant
the thing is over with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s to do?&#8221; asked the woman once
more.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gentlemen are friends to the two lads
up-stairs,&#8221; said the landlord. &#8220;And they desire
that they shall be given into their charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we are to earn the gold so easily as
that,&#8221; said the woman, eagerly, &#8220;there they
sleep above. Take them and welcome.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>&#8220;Perhaps it will not be quite so easy as you
think,&#8221; said Sugden. &#8220;They, more than
likely, will object to accompanying us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried the woman, with a laugh,
&#8220;would they so stand in the way of our earning
a trifle of money? That would be uncivil
of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; said Hawkins, &#8220;they would
object.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great red face of the woman became
overspread with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that they will not
care to make their objections very strong.
We have a way with us&mdash;if you do not forbid
it&mdash;of persuading those who do not fall in with
our desires.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rest assured,&#8221; said Hawkins, &#8220;that we
forbid nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; The huge body of the woman
seemed to quiver like a jelly as she chuckled.
&#8220;I understand you completely, now.&#8221; She
turned to her husband. &#8220;We are forbidden
nothing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Perhaps we can come
upon them much as we&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be still,&#8221; said the landlord, in a low, warning
tone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>But the woman only chuckled the more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you can make the gentlemen
believe we have never undertaken any
such little matters as this before?&#8221; she said.
Then turning to Hawkins, she said, &#8220;But now
that I understand you, sir, I see that thirty
sovereigns would be too little for what you
expect. Be a generous gentleman and make
it fifty. Times are hard, and a thing of this
sort is both dangerous and difficult.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do what I ask, and fifty sovereigns are
yours,&#8221; said Hawkins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spoken like the open-handed gentleman
I took you for,&#8221; cried the landlord&#8217;s wife,
delightedly. &#8220;And now,&#8221; to her husband,
&#8220;let us set to to earn this prize. Do you go
first, and I&#8217;ll follow after with the light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No light,&#8221; said the man sulkily, as though
he did not relish being ordered about. &#8220;A
light would waken them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took a number of straps down from a
peg behind a door where they hung among
some odds and ends of harness. From another
place he took a short, heavy, mace-like weapon,
at sight of which the woman resumed her
chuckling and shaking.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>&#8220;Ah, that is the gentle persuader,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Many&#8217;s the time I&#8217;ve silenced an
over-noisy patron with it. Its reasoning is
short and sharp, my good sirs, and no one
who makes its acquaintance remains unconvinced.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough of your clacking,&#8221; said the landlord,
sharply. &#8220;Let us set about our work.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two lads expected to see them ascend
the rickety staircase; but in this they were
wrong; for after a few brief sentences to the
two guests, the landlord and his wife disappeared
through the doorway leading to the
inner room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; whispered Ben to his companion,
&#8220;what do you think of this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, and it&#8217;s past thinking about it I
am,&#8221; said Paddy Burk. &#8220;Never in the whole
of me life did I see or hear such a lot of complete
blackguards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They will be here in a moment or two,&#8221;
said Ben. &#8220;How shall we receive them?&#8221;</p>

<p>Paddy chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrah,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it&#8217;ll be no great task to
upset the landlord and his fat wife, even
though they have a bludgeon with them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget,&#8221; answered Ben, &#8220;that there
remain the two down-stairs. If the landlord
fails they will not long be idle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; agreed Paddy. &#8220;But, sure, we
have no call to be afeered of them, either.
Let them come, and it&#8217;s a warm reception we
will try and give them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they waited in silence for further developments.
Ben listened intently for the
approach of the pair who were stealing upon
them from somewhere in the darkness. The
lad had noticed no doors in the room, save
the one in the floor, and was puzzled to know
just how they were to be approached.</p>

<p>However, both he and Paddy Burk drew
on their clothing while they waited; and
when this was done, an idea struck Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better have a light ready, so that we
may get a sight of them when they arrive,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that would throw us wide open to a
shot from hiding,&#8221; protested Paddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll arrange that,&#8221; spoke Ben.</p>

<p>With his tinder and flint carefully muffled
he soon had a light; then with a burning
candle screened behind a coat in such a way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
that the only illumination was thrown upon
the far wall, they renewed their waiting.</p>

<p>It was some time before they caught any
sound; and when it came it was apparently
from without. The rain was still falling
briskly; occasionally the thunder pealed and
the sheets of pale lightning flared across the
broken panes. Paddy Burk, whose ear also
detected the movement outside, whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith, it&#8217;s a ducking they are willing to
take, to come at us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; said Ben in the
same low tone. &#8220;Here we are on the second
floor, and yet the sounds are seemingly just
outside the rear windows. I&#8217;m going to find
out about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He crept softly across the room to the point
where he knew the rear windows to be. Then
he carefully lifted his head and peered out.
In a few moments the lightning flared again,
giving him a glimpse of a rain-drenched roof
which was almost even with the sill; and
stealing across this toward the windows at one
of which he stood, was the sharp-faced landlord;
through an open door in the roof the
huge, red-faced woman struggled clumsily.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
At sight of these Ben retreated to where Paddy
crouched in the shadow.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are coming,&#8221; he whispered.</p>

<p>In a very few moments they heard a creaking
at one of the windows, and then a long
pause. It were as though the person without
had caught sight of the dimmed light of the
screened candle and was carefully examining
it. Apparently satisfied, however, the creaking
at the window resumed; a gust of damp
air showed that a sash had been thrust open.
Then a sound of another sort told them that
some one had slid into the room.</p>

<p>Softly, slowly and carefully, footsteps advanced
in the darkness; and when, in Ben&#8217;s
judgment, the intruder had reached the center
of the floor, his waiting hand drew aside the
coat and the candle-light streamed about.</p>

<p>There stood the landlord, arrested in his
next step by the disconcerting illumination;
in his hand he held the bludgeon with which
he had purposed to stun the expectedly sleeping
boys; and framed in the open window
was the huge, red face of his wife.</p>

<p>Seeing that he was detected, the landlord
leaped forward with a snarl; but with a single<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
blow of his pistol butt, Ben Cooper struck him
down. At sight of her husband&#8217;s fall, the
woman burst into a dreadful screech of rage;
and in the midst of this the boys heard the
sudden rush of feet below them; and the
creaking and groaning of the infirm staircase
told them that Tobias Hawkins and the man
with the yellow smile were leaping upward.</p>

<small>HOW BEN AND PADDY BURK MADE AWAY FROM<br />
THE HOUSE OF DANGER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Ben Cooper heard the two men come
plunging up the crazy old stairs, his active
brain at once began to cast about for a means
of defense. The landlord was struggling to
his feet, the blow, perhaps, having been a
glancing one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open the trap,&#8221; cried Ben.</p>

<p>Though he did not understand why, Paddy
instantly did as he was bidden. And as he
was doing so Ben grasped the landlord. The
man struck out wildly, but the lad was behind
him and held him fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down with him,&#8221; said Ben, swiftly.</p>

<p>And Paddy, now grasping the idea, also
seized the man; with a heave they raised him
from his feet. The woman shrieked and
strove to climb in at the window; then the
landlord shot through the trap-door full upon
the oncoming men on the stairs. And this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
latter structure, infirm as it was, could not
bear the sudden shock of the impact; with a
splintering crash the supports gave way; stairway
and men went down amid a cloud of
dust, and a chorus of startled shouts.</p>

<p>Paddy Burk, as he clapped to the trap-door,
laughed gleefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; said he, &#8220;he never made
such a hasty going down-stairs of it in his life
before. And the other two were fair surprised
at his haste, by the looks of their faces when
he met them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You villains,&#8221; wheezed the woman, who,
seeing that success was impossible, had ceased
her efforts to enter by the window. &#8220;You
have killed him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrah, that would be the unlucky thing,
entirely,&#8221; commented Paddy. &#8220;Sure, the like
of him were intended for the gallows, and it&#8217;s
a shame, so it is, that it should be cheated of
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the woman was panting forth some
sort of an answer to this, a gust of wind
extinguished the candle, and under cover of
the darkness they heard her withdraw across
the roof, and go groaning through the scuttle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
Now that their own light was out, that which
came through the crevice in the floor was
plain once more; and acting upon the same
impulse, both boys looked down into the room
below.</p>

<p>From the heap of d&eacute;bris formed by the
collapsed stairway, the three men were just
arising, and their voices were raised in bitter
exclamations against those who had been the
cause of their mishaps.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were awake,&#8221; declared the landlord
as he rubbed his hurts and limped about.
&#8220;They overheard what we were saying and
were waiting for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a numskull!&#8221; stormed Tobias
Hawkins. &#8220;Why did you not say that there
was some chance of their hearing us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How was I to know that they were not
asleep?&#8221; groaned the man. &#8220;Oh, my head,
my head!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a thousand pities that he didn&#8217;t break
your head,&#8221; growled Sugden, trying to remove
the traces of the fall from his clothes. &#8220;But
come,&#8221; his eyes glowing evilly, &#8220;show us the
way you reached them; this time they&#8217;ll not
come off first best, I promise you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>The boys, as they watched, saw the man
take out a heavy pistol.</p>

<p>&#8220;This way to the ladder that leads to the
loft,&#8221; said the landlord, pointing to the inner
door; &#8220;then to the roof itself, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough of that!&#8221; here broke in Tobias
Hawkins. The watchers saw him gesture
upward with one hand, as though warning
them that if the lads had heard what they
had planned previously, they would be likely
to do so again. Then the man began speaking
in a low tone which neither Ben nor Paddy
could catch distinctly. While he talked the
landlord secured a short-barreled musket
from a closet, and Sugden examined his pistol
with attention. A great deal of Hawkins&#8217;
low-voiced talk seemed to be the asking of
questions; the landlord answered with much
gesturing and pointing. And while this was
in progress the huge landlady come rolling in,
and with great spirit and panting eagerness
entered into whatever plans were being made.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I look at her,&#8221; said Paddy Burk, &#8220;faith,
I see not a one of them who&#8217;s more anxious
to do us harm than she is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They all seem determined enough to me,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
said Ben, dryly. &#8220;And I think it&#8217;s time for
us to take some steps to meet them. It will
be no great while now before we have that
short musket and those pistols looking in our
faces.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more the candle was lighted and the
two boys looked about the room carefully.
There were six windows in all; two of these
overlooked the roof in the rear from which
the landlord had entered; two were at the
front with the porch roof directly underneath.</p>

<p>&#8220;They can come upon us as easily from the
front as the rear,&#8221; said Ben. &#8220;These two
windows on the side,&#8221; going to them, candle
in hand, &#8220;overlook the yard which we crossed
in going to the barn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paddy Burk peered out at one of these.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not much of a drop to the ground,&#8221;
said he, recklessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a stone pavement which might
serve to cripple us,&#8221; said Ben. &#8220;Now these,&#8221;
and he bent forward, &#8220;might help us to avoid
an injury.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying he picked up a number of long
straps from the floor. They were the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
that the landlord had brought, apparently
with a view to trussing them up; and when
he had fallen under the pistol butt he had
dropped them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The luck,&#8221; quoth Paddy, &#8220;is with us to-night.
Sure, here we are with the way of
escape placed at our hands by the very blackguard
that would be the first to send a shot
after us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carefully knotting the straps together, they
fastened one end to a rafter, the other they
dropped out at a window; then they collected
their belongings and prepared to depart.
After they had extinguished the candle, they
stood for a moment, listening; there were
careful footsteps below and the sound of a door
opening and closing.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are making ready,&#8221; said Ben, in a
whisper.</p>

<p>With his pistol in one hand Paddy crept out
at the window and slid down the leather rope.
A moment later and Ben had followed him,
and again they stood listening. From the
front came a faint scrambling noise, and Ben
grasped his friend&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some one climbing the porch,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
whispered. &#8220;Some one will also make for the
rear windows&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And would draw our attention&mdash;if we were
here,&#8221; interrupted the astute Paddy. &#8220;And
while we were watching, or fighting with them,
those from the front would jump in on us.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the barn they quickly found their horses,
and led them out. To prevent possible pursuit
and a shot in the dark, Ben also brought out
the horses ridden by Hawkins and Sugden.
One of these he saddled for himself, intending
to lead his own lamed animal; then they
mounted.</p>

<p>As they did so, there came a sudden crash
from the upper story of the inn. Looking up
they could make out nothing, for the night
was thick.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have burst in the windows at the
back,&#8221; said Ben.</p>

<p>And at that instant, as though to prove that
he had judged correctly a few moments before,
there came a second crash. There was a jingle
of glass upon the tavern porch, a shout and
the sound of stamping feet. Then a light
flared up in the windows through one of
which they had just passed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; said Paddy, always ready for
an adventure or a lark, &#8220;that we give them
some small idea as to where we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, actuated by a common impulse, they
drew their pistols and sent a crashing volley
through the lighted squares of glass above.
As the windows splintered before the discharge,
a chorus of startled cries arose, and then with
shouts of laughter at their parting jest, the
two boys clapped spurs to their horses and
went galloping away through the rain.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>TELLS OF MUCH FIGHTING AND ALSO HOW<br />
JOHNSON QUINSEY MADE HIS APPEARANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">General Lord Howe</span> had demonstrated on
many occasions since he had taken command
of the king&#8217;s army that he was a man of small
enterprise; more than once had his failure
to follow up an advantage permitted Washington&#8217;s
force to recuperate after receiving a
staggering blow. After Brandywine the
same thing occurred. Howe, instead of pursuing
the flying Americans as a commander
of proper spirit would have done, camped
upon the field of battle, remaining there two
days.</p>

<p>Washington retreated through Darby, and
crossed the Schuylkill to Germantown, where
his army had a brief rest. Then, with the
idea that Philadelphia must not fall even
though Congress had deserted it, he made up
his mind to advance once more and offer
battle to the British.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>Ben Cooper and Paddy Burk had rejoined
the army before it crossed the river; and now,
when it began to move once more, were among
the light horse which had been sent on in advance.
During the stop at Germantown, Ben
had gathered his friends in their tent and told
them in detail of the conversation which he
had heard at Clark&#8217;s Inn between Tobias Hawkins
and his companion. They all listened
with great attention and interest, and when
he had finished Ezra Prentiss said:</p>

<p>&#8220;So this is the explanation of it. I knew
there was envy of Washington among some of
the other officers, and I heard that there was
jealousy of him, in a certain faction of Congress.
But the reason for these coming together
and making a common cause against
him, I had not known until now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They would risk ruining the country in
order to further their own ends,&#8221; ejaculated
George Prentiss, indignantly. &#8220;With the
same breath that they vote starvation to a
faithful army, they declare themselves patriots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a change a few years can make in
men,&#8221; bemoaned Ben. &#8220;The first Congress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
was made up of giants who had nothing but
freedom from tyranny in their minds, while
this present one is composed, so it would
seem, of some of the smallest spirits in the
land.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat Brewster, always the most thoughtful
of the four, had not said a great deal; but that
night he sought out General Greene and to
him imparted Ben&#8217;s story. The grave-faced
Rhode Islander listened with every evidence
of interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom did you say overheard this talk?&#8221;
he inquired when Nat had finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cooper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Then we can rely upon the report.&#8221;
There was a short silence; then the general
said: &#8220;I will bring the matter to the attention
of the commander-in-chief. In the meantime,
do you keep silent regarding it and warn
your friends to do likewise.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, though Ben expected to be summoned
to headquarters, nothing developed
that the boys could see. Notwithstanding
this, he felt that below the surface of things a
change must be taking place&mdash;that the commander
and his trusted friends were forewarned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
and would now be better prepared to
cope with the insidious danger creeping upon
the states.</p>

<p>As he marched south once more, Washington
left a body of Pennsylvania militia to
guard the city; a number of other detachments
held the various fords of the Schuylkill;
orders were given to unmoor the floating
bridge at the south road; every boat upon
the west bank was taken to the east, and so
an attack was guarded against from this direction.
Down the Lancaster road pushed
the Americans, horse, foot and artillery, the
intention being to outflank the enemy. Howe&#8217;s
scouts, however, brought him news of this
movement, and he at once proceeded to dispose
his army so that he might in turn outflank
the Americans. About a score of miles
from Philadelphia at a place called Warren&#8217;s
Tavern, the two armies came face to face; but
before more than a scattering fire could be
exchanged, a deluge of rain descended, so
wetting the ammunition of the patriots that
the attack had to be abandoned.</p>

<p>Along the streaming roads and under a
ceaseless downpour the army once more took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
up its march of retreat. At Warwick Furnace,
which stood near French Creek, a halt was
made, and the chilled soldiers given a chance
to dry themselves and their ammunition.
From this place General Wayne set off with
his division to endeavor to form a junction
with some Maryland troops which were known
to be somewhere in the rear of the British.
Two nights later, while hanging upon the left
of the enemy, Wayne was surprised by a powerful
party under General Gray. Into the
camp of the unsuspecting Americans plunged
the British, firing no shot, but trusting to the
bayonet for their work of death. In this fight
three hundred of Mad Anthony&#8217;s men were
killed, and the remainder fled.</p>

<p>And it was only a short time after this that
Howe marched toward Reading as though to
seize the American stores gathered in that
town. Upon the opposite side of the river
Washington kept him in sight. Some two-score
miles above Philadelphia, the British
made an unexpected move in the night. A
swift countermarch, a crossing of a ford, and
next morning he was between Washington
and the city, which he now proceeded to occupy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
without resistance. There was a parade
of troops through Philadelphia&mdash;the second
within a few weeks&mdash;but how vast was the
difference between the two. The first was
that of an unkempt, semi-rabble, unshaven,
ragged, badly armed, and with little training;
the second was brilliant with gorgeously uniformed
officers, shining with brass and gleaming
with steel; the disciplined troops marched
in steady, solid columns; powerful batteries
trailed at the heels of great English horses;
dragoons, mounted upon fiery chargers,
pranced along in seemingly endless ranks.
Little wonder if those true to the cause remaining
in Philadelphia were shaken with
doubt at this splendid display of British
power; the Tories were exultant; the patriots
looked on with brooding eyes, defiant still,
but with despair in their hearts.</p>

<p>Everywhere the detractors of the commander-in-chief
of the American army were
busy; in the streets and public places of the
city, and the towns round about; in the
country roads when men met, and in inns
where travelers foregathered, the bitter venom
of petty spirits was heard, the brutal criticism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
of minds uninformed upon the points at issue
was loud and long.</p>

<p>&#8220;We provide him with an army, and he
uses it to race the roads with,&#8221; would be the
cry of one.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has trained it to run from the British,
and not to fight them,&#8221; declares another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give us a general who has a knowledge
of the country&#8217;s needs,&#8221; implores a third.
&#8220;Washington will remain without striking a
blow for so long that we shall be too weak,
finally, to ever strike it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give us Gates as a leader,&#8221; proclaimed the
friends of that general, &#8220;and the country will
be saved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lee would be the man,&#8221; cried still another
faction who held that general in much esteem.
&#8220;If Lee were only not a prisoner of the
British.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so it went, seeming to gather strength
each day. Statesmen spoke publicly of the
weakness, as they styled it, of Washington;
and urged their fellow members in Congress
to depose him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has shown his unfitness to command
the nation&#8217;s forces from the beginning,&#8221; they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
said. &#8220;But in nothing has it been more
openly shown than in the campaign just closing.
He has wasted a month in fruitless
marching and countermarching.&#8221;</p>

<p>To all but those who had the entire field of
action in mind, this last seemed true. But to
the few who knew the broad purpose of the
great general it was the charge of gross ignorance.
A month had been used, indeed, but it
had not been wasted. Away in northern New
York the powerful army of Burgoyne had
slowly moved southward, driving the Americans
before it through the wilderness. Day
after day the patriots had fallen back before
the allied British, Hessians and Indians, and
day after day they drew them further from
their base. It had been the understanding
between Howe and Burgoyne that the former
was to make a rush upon Philadelphia, take
it and then send a huge reinforcement to the
aid of the latter. But Washington understood
this and kept Howe so busily engaged
that he could not afford to send any of his
force to form the junction with his fellow
general; and now, because of this failure,
Burgoyne was facing a mass of New York<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
and New England troops with every prospect
of defeat.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is shameful!&#8221; declared young Lafayette,
in his broken English. &#8220;It is unjust and unfair!
They do not understand, and yet they
will not hold their peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>As far as could be seen, all this clamor had
no effect on Washington; he calmly looked
over the prospects before him, disdaining the
petty natures which threw themselves in his
way; and before long he saw an opportunity
to strike a blow which might undo all that
Howe had gained.</p>

<p>Ben Cooper and George Prentiss rode into
the American camp on the Skippack Creek
one afternoon early in October. They had
come upon news of an important movement
and were in haste to bring it to headquarters.</p>

<p>&#8220;A large body of the enemy have been sent
against the Delaware River forts,&#8221; was their
report; &#8220;and another, almost as large, is conveying
provisions; the camp at Germantown
is none too strongly manned.&#8221;</p>

<p>That very night the army was under arms
and advancing upon Germantown, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
Howe was encamped; Philadelphia, some
miles away, was in charge of Cornwallis
and another force. Four columns streamed
through the October dusk along as many
roads; two were to attack the enemy&#8217;s center,
the others were to leap upon either flank.</p>

<p>At dawn on the fourth of October, the onset
was made; the columns consisting of Sullivan&#8217;s,
Wayne&#8217;s and Conway&#8217;s commands
plunged at the enemy as the pickets sounded
the alarm. A battalion of infantry and
Musgrave&#8217;s veteran regiment felt the lead and
steel of Mad Anthony&#8217;s men, who burned to
avenge their defeat at Paoli; back went the
British unable to steady themselves against
the shock. But Musgrave threw himself and
a few hundred men into Chew House, barricaded
the doors and windows and prepared
for defense. Musket and grape-shot tore holes
in the British, still retreating in spite of the
pleadings of General Howe, who had sprung
from his bed when he heard the confusion of
the flight.</p>

<p>But instead of leaving a small force to cope
with Musgrave and his improvised fortress
and following Howe, the American column<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
came to a stand and spent the greater
part of a half hour in the endeavor to take it.
This delay gave the British time to collect
themselves; and when the Americans did
finally press on, they met with a determined
resistance; also a dense fog settled upon everything
and they could not recognize friend
from foe; different detachments would come
upon each other and begin a destructive fire
which would do great harm before either
learned the other&#8217;s true quality. And finally,
when a cannonade away in the rear was opened
upon Musgrave&#8217;s men in Chew House, the
division under Wayne became panic stricken,
thinking an enemy had gotten behind them.
Headlong they fled, and in their flight encountered
another brigade in the fog under the
American general, Stephens, who took them
for an attacking enemy, and also began to retreat.
Then confusion sprang up everywhere,
until seeing that it was useless to continue an
enterprise so stricken with disorder, Washington,
who had been in the heaviest of the fight,
ordered a retreat, and the army disappeared
in the fog with the cavalry, under the soldier-like
Count Pulaski, covering its rear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>This spirited, but apparently unsuccessful
dash upon the enemy was followed by excellent
results. It taught the British that they
could not be sure of their ground for a day at
a time and so restricted their operations to a
limited area about the city. But the enemies
of the commander-in-chief did not, of course,
take this view of the matter; it was a new repulse,
they said, and their clamor for his removal
grew louder than before.</p>

<p>A few days later, the Hudson River forts,
Clinton and Montgomery, fell before the wily
attack of the enemy; then Fort Constitution
was abandoned, and the great waterway was
open to the enemy as far as Albany. But
Clinton neglected to take advantage of this
opportunity to go to the aid of the fated Burgoyne;
the result was that, on October 17th,
that general gave up his sword to Gates at
Saratoga.</p>

<p>When this later news filtered through to the
American camp it added fuel to the fires
already so fiercely burning.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will scarcely be any holding them
now,&#8221; said Ben Cooper, as he discussed the
matter with his friends. &#8220;Gates will be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
national hero, and the cries for him will be
redoubled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They say that General Gates is so inflated
by his success that he deemed it beneath him
to make a report of his victory to the commander-in-chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His victory, did you say, young gentleman?&#8221;
spoke a heavy voice almost at the
boy&#8217;s elbow. &#8220;The victory of General Gates?
Well, well&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and here the words were lost
in a laugh.</p>

<p>The army of Washington was at this time
occupying a strong position among the wooded
heights at Whitemarsh, some distance from
Philadelphia; the afternoon was cold and the
boys were clustered about a camp-fire in the
shelter of a hill. At sound of the words and
the jeering laugh that followed them, they
turned curiously, and saw a short, stocky man
in horseman&#8217;s dress, standing near by. And
as they turned he nodded his head good-naturedly
and moved nearer to the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it does not inconvenience you,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll share a bit of the blaze with you, for I&#8217;ve
had a cold, long ride, and I&#8217;m fair chilled
through.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>The lads made room for him willingly
enough; he seated himself upon a log and
spread his strong, short-fingered hands out to
the black-tipped jets of light that leaped from
the green wood.</p>

<p>&#8220;The victory of General Gates, says you!&#8221;
Again the man laughed and again he nodded
his head. &#8220;Ah, yes, yes, that&#8217;s what it will
be called; but, between us all, and in confidence,
mind you, Gates had no more to do with
the beating of Burgoyne than either one of
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean,&#8221; said Ben Cooper, &#8220;that
Schuyler prepared the way&mdash;roused the countryside&mdash;bore
the hardships that went before
and all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you understand that part of it, and,
believe me, young gentlemen, it&#8217;s true as gospel.
Schuyler wore his heart out trying to
get men to stand to the cause; he worked
night and day breaking the British strength
bit by bit, and when it was all ready for him
to strike, Congress removes him and sends
Gates.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it is because of this,&#8221; said Nat Brewster,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
&#8220;that you say Gates had no more to do
with it than either of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be enough, indeed,&#8221; answered
the man in the riding dress. &#8220;But, as it happens,
it is not at all the chief reason for what
I say. We of the army of the north hated to
see General Schuyler go, but if we had received
a fighter in his place we would not have cared
so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ezra Prentiss regarded the speaker with interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you are of the northern
army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;My name is
Johnson Quinsey, and I come from the neighborhood
of Fort Edward. It may interest
you all to know,&#8221; and again his good-natured
smile went from one to another about the fire,
&#8220;that I am the courier who brought General
Gates&#8217; report to Congress.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a stir among his young listeners,
and George Prentiss asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, perhaps, you took part in the
Saratoga fight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I did,&#8221; replied the courier, his hands
held out to the blaze, &#8220;that I did, young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
gentleman, and a tolerable fight it was. But
Gates you hear of, only&mdash;Gates! Gates! they
cry wherever I go. But it&#8217;s naught but the
plain truth when I repeat it; Gates had no
more to do with the victory than either of
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he directed the course of battle,&#8221;
said Nat Brewster.</p>

<p>But Johnson Quinsey held up one hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sore thing to say against an American
leader,&#8221; spoke he, &#8220;but he might as well&mdash;aye,
much better&mdash;have stopped at home.
Schuyler, like the honest high soul that he is,
took him by the hand when he came&mdash;never
a thought of jealousy had he in his mind for
the man who was taking his place. But
Gates, when he held a council of war, invited
some inconsequential officers to take part; and
General Schuyler was ignored.&#8221;</p>

<p>A murmur went around among the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when the fight began at Bemis
Heights did our General Gates lead his men?
No! such dangers he left to others. Like a
fine gentleman he took his ease in his camp,
well removed from the field. Arnold had to
beg permission to begin the battle.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>&#8220;A brilliant officer that General Arnold,&#8221;
said Nat, admiringly, and Johnson Quinsey
nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is none more able or daring in the
whole army. A hard man he is, with a cruel
eye and the temper of a fiend; but he wins
battles that for others would be defeats. As
it stands, he is the real victor of Saratoga, if
you must pick any single man.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a short silence; then the man
went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;The first fight shattered Burgoyne&#8217;s force
badly. Arnold had been in the thick of it,
and knew this, and when morning came he
once more besought Gates to let him advance.
But Gates would not. He felt that he had a
victory in his hands and his little spirit was
vexed at what he thought interference. You
should have seen him swell like a turkey
cock and rear his head. His empty vanity
maddened the other; I was close by and saw
the red rage in Arnold&#8217;s eyes. In a fury he
demanded a pass to go to General Washington&#8217;s
camp; and, afraid of his genius,
Gates gladly gave it to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he did not use it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>&#8220;No; I suppose calmer thought told him
that it would not look well to leave the army
in the face of the enemy, so he remained,
though his command was given to General
Lincoln. For two weeks he fretted and
fumed, and for two weeks Gates preened
himself like an empty-headed dandy. And
when the second battle was raging, Arnold,
burning to show his zeal and display the
wrongs that had been done him, suddenly
emerged from his tent, leaped upon a horse
and dashed toward the place where the roar
of the guns told him the engagement was the
most desperate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Johnson Quinsey grimaced and
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;They say,&#8221; he proceeded, &#8220;that Gates, as
before, taking his ease in camp while others
did the fighting, saw Arnold dash away, and
filled with alarm, sent an aide speeding after
him to forbid his taking part in the battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the aide did not overtake him, I&#8217;ll
warrant you,&#8221; said George Prentiss, his eyes
shining.</p>

<p>&#8220;He might as well have pursued the wind;
Arnold rode his great brown horse &#8216;Warren,&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
and in a little while was careering through a
sleet of bullets from friend and foe to reach
his old command. In quiet times in camp
General Arnold is no gentle officer; but in the
fight his men think him unbeatable. So
when they saw him, though he had no right
to command them, they shouted for joy; he
threw himself at their head and led them like
a band of demons at the enemy. Nothing
could stand before him; he raged up and down
the field like a madman, the British and
Hessians flying before his plunging brigade
as though its very aspect struck terror to their
hearts. Rushing up to the very muzzles of
the Hessians&#8217; muskets at a stockade, he drove
them out, but fell with a shattered leg.
And,&#8221; here Johnson Quinsey laughed grimly,
&#8220;General Gates&#8217; messenger came up to him,
as his men were bearing him to the rear in a
litter. But it was too late to do any harm.
Arnold had already won the battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>For quite some time the boys sat discussing
the surrender of Burgoyne; then a trooper
came up, calling:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cooper! Cooper! To report to headquarters
at once!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>Ben arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be a cold night for the saddle,&#8221; smiled
he, &#8220;but then, we can&#8217;t choose our weather.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had departed, with a wave of his hand,
and had proceeded some hundred yards or
more upon his way, when he heard a step in
the snow at his side; and glancing up, he
recognized the courier, Johnson Quinsey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pardon,&#8221; said the man, and in the
rays of a near-by camp-fire, Ben noted an intent
expression upon his face. &#8220;I heard you
answer to the name of Cooper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Ben, &#8220;is my name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin Cooper?&#8221; The man&#8217;s head
bent a trifle nearer, as though to show the increase
of his interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;The same,&#8221; answered the boy.</p>

<p>There was a brief pause, then the man said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is odd how chance guides one&#8217;s footsteps,
at times. When I approached that fire
where you sat I had no thought of meeting
with you, and yet it was the hope of seeing
you, alone, that brought me to this encampment.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />


<small>IN WHICH BEN MEETS A STRANGER AND HEARS<br />
OF THE INN WITH THE GREEN LIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a space after Johnson Quinsey spoke
these surprising words, Ben remained looking
at him, steadily, but in silence. At length he
spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am honored, indeed, Master Quinsey, to
know that I am considered worthy of the
trouble it must have cost you to get here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnson Quinsey waved his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us not start with any misunderstanding,&#8221;
said he, with engaging candor. &#8220;The
fact is, I did not know that such a person as
yourself existed before two days ago. Another
thing, it is a matter of business, and not yourself
that brings me; so you see there is no
great honor attached to the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben laughed; there was something about
the courier&#8217;s blunt way of speech which he
liked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, as to that,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;of course
I am vastly disappointed. But we&#8217;ll pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
that by and come to the business without any
parleying. I am wanted at headquarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnson Quinsey smacked his boot-leg
smartly with his thick-stocked whip.</p>

<p>&#8220;For a lad,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you have a clever
knack of promptness. I noted that when you
answered the call, and I was pleased with it.&#8221;
He stood gazing at the boy, reflectively.
&#8220;But,&#8221; he resumed, musingly, &#8220;I had no
notion when I first heard your name that it
was that of such a stripling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The stripling stage,&#8221; said Ben, good-humoredly,
&#8220;will pass if given time, Master
Quinsey. And remember,&#8221; smiling, &#8220;that
years alone do not give wisdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well do I know that, young gentleman,&#8221;
said the other; &#8220;well indeed do I know it.
I have seen them who are three times your
years, and not once have they been spoken of
as I have heard you spoken of.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_252.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;I &nbsp;AM SUMMONED TO HEADQUARTERS&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Ben Cooper, &#8220;it&#8217;s a grave pleasure
to be well spoken of by distant friends.
Walk along with me to headquarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, that it is,&#8221; and the tone of the man&#8217;s
voice was slightly mocking.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span> &#8220;That it is, my
lad. But what if you should hear that you
were ill spoken of, and that the distant ones
were not friends?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Ben, promptly enough,
&#8220;I should say that it were all one. To have
enemies speak evil of one is to show that one
is at least worthy of their ill will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If all that I&#8217;ve heard,&#8221; said Johnson
Quinsey, &#8220;be taken at its face value, you are
ill thought of, indeed, in certain circles.
But,&#8221; and the man&#8217;s face grew grave and his
tone lost its lightness, &#8220;it was not mere ill
speaking only that I marked. They fear
you; and where such as they fear, there is
danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the person feared?&#8221; said Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. And their arms are long, young
gentleman, and their clutch is strong. They
are not ones to be despised, these enemies of
yours at York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At York!&#8221; said Ben. The Congress was
now meeting there. His eyes took on a
glint that the other noted immediately. It
was that sparkle which comes with expectation.</p>

<p>&#8220;No less a place,&#8221; said Johnson Quinsey.
Then regarding the boy steadfastly, he continued:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
&#8220;It may be that you could, if you so
desired, name one or more of these.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy that I could name one at least,&#8221;
said Ben. &#8220;And, perhaps,&#8221; returning the
man&#8217;s look, quietly, &#8220;there might be two
whom I could select.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, perhaps there might,&#8221; said Johnson
Quinsey, encouragingly. &#8220;And to venture
so far&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tobias Hawkins,&#8221; spoke Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent,&#8221; approved the man. &#8220;Once
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A long man with an evil smile; his name
is Sugden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better than ever,&#8221; applauded Johnson
Quinsey. &#8220;It is something indeed to know
two such as these, especially,&#8221; with a nod of
the head, &#8220;when they hold such thoughts as
I&#8217;ve heard them express of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Ben, &#8220;there were some others,
I believe, judging from your tone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A very few, but quite select enough to
please any one,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;You have
no need to feel ashamed of the quality of the
enemies you have made. A member of Congress
or two, a colonel much thought of in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
certain circles, and some gentlemen of note
who are not openly connected with the affairs
of the nation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They honor me too much,&#8221; said Ben.
&#8220;But,&#8221; in another tone, &#8220;as you know, I am
summoned to headquarters, and must not delay.
At another time I will see you and
speak with you on this subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another time may not come for many a
day,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;And then, doubtless,
it would be too late. What I have to say
must be said now if it&#8217;s to do you any good,
for I ride north at daylight to rejoin Gates.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben looked at the speaker inquiringly; the
man&#8217;s aspect was grave; indeed, he had all
the appearance of one who bore sober tidings.
After a little space, Johnson Quinsey resumed:</p>

<p>&#8220;To relate in detail all that has come to
my knowledge would take more time than
you now can give, and, perhaps, would be of
no benefit either. So, then, I will tell you
what I must tell, in a very few words.&#8221; He
laid his hand upon the boy&#8217;s shoulder.
&#8220;These men fear you for the things that you
know, and to which you alone can testify.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
There is a plot which is intended to place
you in their power. What it is I do not
know. But its workings will be secret, and
the lure will be one totally unexpected by
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are many such just now,&#8221; said Ben,
bitterly. &#8220;Indeed, Master Quinsey, those
given to plotting seem to exceed those willing
to fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know any one of the name of
Seaforth?&#8221; asked Johnson Quinsey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Ben. &#8220;A young fellow of my
own age, and a courier much used by headquarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I see!&#8221; The man looked at him
with sober eyes. &#8220;Well, Master Cooper, take
care of this young Seaforth, for he is somehow
engaged with your enemies. Another thing:
Do the words &#8216;Crossed keys&#8217; suggest anything
to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;In some way they, also, are to play their
parts, though just how is more than I can
say. However, young gentleman, beware of
Seaforth and of anything having to do with
&#8216;crossed keys.&#8217; More than that I cannot tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
you, and in parting I can only wish you
luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben grasped the courier&#8217;s outstretched hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you,&#8221; he said, gratefully. &#8220;I
understand very well that harm is meditated,
for these men have attempted such before;
but how they propose to set about it this time
is more than I can imagine. However, Master
Quinsey, I will keep Seaforth in mind and
also the &#8216;crossed keys.&#8217; Perhaps they will be
the beginning of a clearer understanding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust that it shall prove so,&#8221; said the
rider; &#8220;and now, good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>With another hand-grasp the two parted,
one walking off among the camp-fires, the
other making his way toward headquarters.</p>

<p>Once at the latter place, Ben was greeted
by a businesslike aide.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cooper,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we are instructed to
send a brace of couriers for special service at
York. The man asked for is now absent, and
I intend sending you in his place. The choice
of a second horseman is left to him for some
reason, and this privilege I will pass on to
you. So select your man; your orders will
be given you when you are ready to depart.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>&#8220;To-night?&#8221; asked Ben, his hand at a
salute.</p>

<p>&#8220;At once,&#8221; replied the officer, briefly.</p>

<p>In a half hour Ben Cooper and Paddy
Burk were standing on the cold porch at
headquarters, while their horses stamped in
the snow. The bareheaded aide from the
open doorway spoke to Ben:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are to report to the secretary of Congress;
what service you are to render he will
be able to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that Ben and his friend saluted and
mounted; then they sent their nags at a
canter along the darkening road.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no night to be taken away from a
comfortable fire,&#8221; shivered the Irish lad as he
drew up the collar of his coat and pulled his
hat down to protect him from the keen wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adventures are to be had at night,
Paddy,&#8221; laughed Ben. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;it&#8217;s the truth
you speak, so it is. A ruction is a fine thing
at any time; but at night&mdash;especially on a
dark, cold night&mdash;there seems to be more enjoyment
in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The horses&#8217; hoofs beat steadily upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
frost-bound road; mile after mile they put
behind them; the few houses to be met by
the way were dark; their inhabitants seemed
deep in sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith,&#8221; said Paddy, after a long silence,
&#8220;it&#8217;s a queer thing entirely to have a couple
of gossoons ride all the way from Whitemarsh
to York to, maybe, carry a parcel of letters
somewhere else. Could they get no ready lads
at their hands, sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Special service of some sort,&#8221; said Ben.
&#8220;It can be nothing of any great haste, however,
for it will take some little time for us to
get there.&#8221;</p>

<p>They clung to the Lancaster road, and as
raiding bodies of British were frequently seen
upon this highway, the boys kept a watchful
eye, and saw to it that their pistols were ready
to hand. As the night wore on, it grew, if
anything, colder; the road seemed deserted
save for themselves.</p>

<p>Ben had made up his mind to this, when
suddenly he chanced to notice, some little distance
to one side, a flicker of light. He was
about to remark on its queerness when Paddy
spoke:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>&#8220;Hello! Is it a light I see there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; said Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; spoke Paddy, &#8220;it&#8217;s queer
conduct it do be having, so it is. Do you
mind the little jumps it gives, as though it
were trying to call out to us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben&#8217;s eyes were upon the light as his companion
spoke, and he felt that Paddy had described
the idea conveyed by the light exactly.
It moved in short, rapid circles for a moment;
then it would wave to and fro, and up and
down.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it had a voice it would call to us,&#8221; said
Ben with a laugh. &#8220;I never saw anything
so mutely eloquent. It must be a signal of
some sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The British!&#8221; whispered Paddy, his hand
going to his pistol.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be,&#8221; said Ben. &#8220;And then it may
not be.&#8221; He slipped from his horse and
handed his bridle to Paddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it going over there you are?&#8221; asked the
latter, surprise in his tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ben. &#8220;It seems to me that
this is something that should be looked into.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then telling Paddy to remain where he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
until he called, Ben made his way through the
darkness toward the light. This had now
grown still and burned with a steadiness that
showed that it was a lamp of some sort.
Carefully Ben picked his way along a sort of
cow path that branched off from the road, and
in a very few minutes he came upon a huge
fallen tree, against the trunk of which leaned
a man holding a lantern in his hand. As Ben
advanced toward him the man held up the
light and chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were not going to stop,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;But I see you were on the lookout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He who goes about with closed eyes on
nights like these,&#8221; spoke Ben, &#8220;will be like
to run into danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dangers there be, and plenty,&#8221; said the
man. He placed his lantern upon the fallen
tree and took a few steps up and down, swinging
his arms. And as he stepped there came
a sharp, clicking sound; glancing down Ben
saw that the man wore a wooden leg, the top
of which was shod with iron. &#8220;Danger there
be and plenty,&#8221; repeated the man with the
wooden leg. &#8220;And that you&#8217;d find, sir, if you
really went all the way to York.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>Ben glanced sharply at the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what,&#8221; asked he, &#8220;makes you think
that I might be on my way there?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man paused in his walk and turned a
face upon the lad, all agrin in the lamplight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us not discuss the how or why of
things,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It is for us to do as we
are bidden and question nothing, Master Seaforth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Ben&#8217;s eyes went to the man&#8217;s face
with more than usual sharpness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seaforth!&#8221; was what shot through his
mind. &#8220;That is the name of the man whom
Johnson Quinsey bid me beware of, only a
few hours ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the other, however, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have made something of a mistake, I
think, sir. My name is not Seaforth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The iron-shod point of the timber leg rang
sharply upon the frozen ground. The owner
of it waved his hand after the fashion of a
man who concerns himself with nothing which
does not immediately bear upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were sent as a courier to York, were
you not?&#8221; asked he.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>Ben nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you selected a certain one to accompany
you, as requested?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let your name be what you will,&#8221;
said the one-legged man. &#8220;I have nothing to
do with your likes and dislikes in such things.
I was to meet you here, and I was to signal
you. And then I was to see that your companion
was not within ear-shot, after which I
was to tell you that your stopping place shows
a green light over the door. Once inside you
are to ask for Master Bleekwood. He will
tell you the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a time Ben stood looking at the man;
a score of questions were in his mind, but a
natural caution even in the midst of his surprise
prevented the asking of them. However,
he ventured one:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why were not these instructions given me
before I started?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the man grinned; also he took his
lantern as though about to move on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you were not to be
trusted. It sometimes happens, as you must
know, if you are a person of any wide experience,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
that it does not do to make too complete
a revelation of one&#8217;s plans at first&mdash;even to
those whom we know the best.&#8221; He waved his
lantern at Ben. &#8220;A good-night&mdash;or morning
whichever it may be&mdash;to you, young sir. It&#8217;s
over cold to be standing in the open. November
nights are not like those of August.&#8221; He
stumped away a short distance, then turned
and placed his hand to his mouth that his
voice might carry only in the direction he
desired. &#8220;Remember, there is to be a green
light showing over the door; and you are to
ask for Master Bleekwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he waved the lantern, and again he
turned and went his way, the iron tip of the
wooden leg ringing against the frozen ground.</p>

<p>In a few moments Ben had reached his
horse and mounted; and in a few more he had
imparted to Paddy what had passed. He had
already informed the Irish lad concerning his
conversation with Johnson Quinsey, and at
this new cropping up of the name of Seaforth,
Paddy was surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s queer enough,&#8221; he said, as they rode
along, &#8220;to have one so quickly follow upon
the heels of the other. &#8216;Beware of a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
named Seaforth,&#8217; says one man; and &#8216;Your
name is Seaforth,&#8217; says the other, for all the
world as though he were expecting this same
person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which he was, in point of fact,&#8221; said Ben.
&#8220;He said he was sent to signal him, to say
to him, privately, that he was to stop at a
house which showed a green light above the
door.&#8221;</p>

<p>For an hour they rode steadily, discussing
with interest this queer new turn of events.</p>

<p>&#8220;Green is an excellent color for a light,&#8221;
quoth Paddy, sagely, &#8220;but in this case, faith,
it&#8217;s little enough I like it. It&#8217;s better for
you if you take warning by what Master
Quinsey said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said nothing about green lights,&#8221;
smiled Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;He would if he had thought of it,&#8221; maintained
Paddy.</p>

<p>And at his last word he noted Ben draw up
close beside him and felt his grip upon his
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look&mdash;directly ahead,&#8221; said Ben. &#8220;What
do you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An inn,&#8221; said Paddy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>&#8220;There is a light above the door,&#8221; and Ben&#8217;s
grip tightened. &#8220;What color is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Green!&#8221; answered Paddy Burk, and he
sat straight up in his saddle.</p>

<small>HOW BEN AND HIS FRIEND PAUSED AT &#8220;THE<br />
CROSSED KEYS&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a space Ben Cooper and Paddy Burk
sat their horses in the cold road, and stared
at the house which showed the green light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Ben, &#8220;there it is! At least
our one-legged friend was no dealer in untruths.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paddy wagged his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he, &#8220;he was not. But sorra the
one of me would trust much to him for all. I
didn&#8217;t see him, to be sure, but for all that, I
take him to be a blackguard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be,&#8221; said Ben, &#8220;that he is that, and
perhaps worse than that. But,&#8221; and there
was a note in the boy&#8217;s voice which his companion
had come to know, &#8220;I rather fancy
that there is considerable interest behind what
he said; and perhaps we should not pass this
place by without giving it a glance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There it is, then,&#8221; said Paddy. &#8220;There it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
is before you. So take your glance and let us
be off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A glance at the inside,&#8221; smiled Ben.
&#8220;There may be something under that green
light which we should know about.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Paddy Burk shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better leave it alone,&#8221; spoke he.</p>

<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; said Ben, in a tone of banter, &#8220;do
you at last pass by a chance for a &#8216;ruction&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith, then,&#8221; and Paddy slipped from his
horse, &#8220;at a hint like that, it&#8217;s not for my
father&#8217;s son to hang back. Come along, then;
I&#8217;m with you to the end of it, whatever it
brings us to.&#8221;</p>

<p>But now it was Ben who showed the
greatest caution. As he, too, dismounted, he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be best, perhaps, for us to tie our
horses at the roadside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrah, but you have the fine head on
you, so you have,&#8221; admired Paddy. &#8220;A
good notion it is, for sorra the one of us
knows how soon or how suddenly we&#8217;ll be
wanting them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly the two horses were made fast
to a tree near at hand; then the lads advanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
toward the house with the green
light.</p>

<p>It was a low stone structure with broad,
small paned windows and a huge sloping
porch. Directly over the door burned a
lantern of green glass, and through the
windows streamed the yellow illumination of
candles. As they stepped upon the porch, the
murmur of many voices came to their ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have a most excellent patronage for
a place so situated,&#8221; spoke Paddy Burk, after
a glance through one of the windows. &#8220;Sure
a body would think a tavern upon a road like
this would be lonely enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben lifted the great wrought-iron latch and
opened the door. The place was filled with a
babble of voices; a knot of men sat at each
table eating and drinking and talking loudly;
a huge fire of logs blazed and roared in the
chimney place; there was a bustle of serving
men and women, and over all, the fat landlord
beamed smilingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A cold night, sir,&#8221; said this worthy, to
Ben, with a little bow, &#8220;a cold night for the
road, young gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cold enough,&#8221; replied Ben, cheerily.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
&#8220;And your excellent fire is none amiss, landlord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless you,&#8221; smiled the host, &#8220;you are not
the first to find that out to-night, by a good
bit, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite a company,&#8221; said Ben, and as he
spoke he surveyed the gathering curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite, sir,&#8221; answered the other, well
pleased. &#8220;It taxes us to serve them all; but
we are being paid for it in coin, so what
matters a trifle of labor? At times like these
when the Americans come down on us we are
usually paid in notes,&#8221; and the landlord made
a wry face. &#8220;And when it&#8217;s the British, they
do not bother to pay at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a short silence, then Ben said in
a low voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps, sir, you might have the acquaintance
of a Master Bleekwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>The expression upon the host&#8217;s face changed
instantly from one of careless good humor to
one of acute interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, so it is you, then,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am
most pleased to see you, indeed.&#8221; Then lifting
his voice he called, before Ben could prevent
him:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>&#8220;Master Bleekwood, a gentleman desires
the favor of a word with you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the far end of the room a man in a
brown velvet coat arose. He was tall and
thin and had cadaverous cheeks and long
hair, tied in the back and faintly powdered.
He approached with hasty, nervous steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said he to Ben, &#8220;I am pleased to see
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing behindhand, the lad replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;And I am glad to see you, Master Bleekwood.
Indeed, I have had quite a deal of
interest in you from the moment I first heard
your name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said the man in the brown velvet
coat, &#8220;is exceedingly kind of you.&#8221; His eyes
went nervously about, as though he feared
his words might be overheard. &#8220;But,&#8221; resumed
he, &#8220;let us find a more secluded place;
it is exceedingly annoying that there should
be so many here just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How does it happen so?&#8221; asked Ben, as
they went down the room, and took seats at a
table which had been occupied by Master
Bleekwood alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;People interested in our matters going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
to York to attend Congress,&#8221; nodded the
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Ben, wisely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you understand,&#8221; said Bleekwood.
Then, after a glance over the company, he
went on: &#8220;It will be no great while, now,
before we have the movement upon a most
excellent footing. And when that is finally
accomplished, the object of our labors will be
accomplished shortly after.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; said Ben, with the same air of
knowledge. &#8220;Not the slightest doubt in the
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cadaverous Master Bleekwood coughed
behind his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite pleased to find you so very
confident,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I am delighted, in
fact. You see,&#8221; and he bent confidentially
toward Ben, &#8220;I am not at all the sort of person
to be engaged in this matter&mdash;least of all
the matter of to-night. My nerves are not of
the strongest, and the condition of things is
quite a pressure upon them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can understand that very well,&#8221; said
Ben, groping in the dark, but determined
to go as far as he might in the matter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
&#8220;These are troublous times in more ways
than one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, yes,&#8221; said Master Bleekwood.
&#8220;Indeed, yes, sir.&#8221; His eyes wandered back
to the spot where he had greeted Ben, and he
added: &#8220;That is&mdash;ah&mdash;your friend, I take
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben glanced in the same direction as his
companion and saw Paddy engaged in what
seemed a most interesting conversation with
the landlord.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Ben, nodding, &#8220;that is my
friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He seems over young for one who has
caused so much unrest,&#8221; complained Master
Bleekwood. &#8220;But,&#8221; as he shook his head
sadly, &#8220;one cannot go by ages in these strange
times. Why, they say Lafayette himself is
not yet twenty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more than that, at the most,&#8221; spoke
Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;And to think that one so youthful must
have so much power invested in his personality,&#8221;
sighed the melancholy Bleekwood.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a most strange thing, sir, most
strange.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>&#8220;Lafayette, you mean, of course,&#8221; said Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh? Oh, no, no! Your&mdash;ah&mdash;friend,
yonder. He has told what he knows, to be
sure; but that matters little. What is to be
guarded against is his testimony, should any
slip ever be made and the entire matter come
to a&mdash;well&mdash;ah&mdash;public hearing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Master Hawkins is a most careful gentleman,&#8221;
spoke Bleekwood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Master Tobias Hawkins!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He is extraordinarily careful. He
says the small things are the ones which usually
wreck the largest enterprises.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps there is much wisdom in that,&#8221;
spoke the lad, now more alert than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say there is. But Master Hawkins
finds many impediments in his path. Congress,
or a part of it, is anxious enough to
dispossess the commander-in-chief. But there
are some steps which it will not countenance,
and which must not be brought to its
notice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure,&#8221; said the lad. &#8220;That I supposed
taken for granted. The present affair
now is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he paused, questioningly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>&#8220;Is one of them? Why, yes.&#8221; Master
Bleekwood seemed very much troubled. &#8220;It
is of that sort, I understand.&#8221; He paused a
moment, and then once more leaned toward
Ben, confidentially. &#8220;And this being the
case, I am convinced that it should not have
been entrusted to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; said Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;A person with stronger nerves, now,&#8221; said
Master Bleekwood, &#8220;would have been a more
fitting selection. It has sometimes occurred
to me that I would scarcely be prepared to
cope with a sudden emergency.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time Ben&#8217;s attention was caught
by something in the man&#8217;s tone&mdash;a lurking
something which did not at all agree with his
words. Without appearing to do so, Ben
looked more closely into the face of the other.
Its drawn thinness, he now saw, was not the
result of disease. The jaw was square and
powerful; the eyes, which had seemed
sunken, he now noted were merely overshadowed
by more than usually high cheek
bones.</p>

<p>&#8220;The coping with sudden emergencies is
scarcely my best quality,&#8221; said the man, still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
in low-voiced confidence. &#8220;I am hardly
what would be called a man of action.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lurking in the eyes of the speaker as he
said this was a glint of mockery, which did
not escape the boy. And, as he caught it, the
suspicion at once flashed through his mind:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he playing with me? Is all that he has
said mere pretense?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Bleekwood proceeded:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Master Sugden who approached me
first. He seemed to fancy me for the task,
for some reason.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A young gentleman of the name of Seaforth
will ride the road to York on such and
such a night,&#8217; said he to me. &#8216;And there will
bear him company another young gentleman
of the name of Cooper.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben started at this, but covered the fact by
making a pretense of turning slightly in his
chair. Bleekwood went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The matter is one to be kept secret,&#8217; said
Sugden to me, &#8216;for there are foolish prejudices
abroad as to certain things. The youth Seaforth
you may trust to do his share of what&#8217;s
going forward. And you will meet him and
the&mdash;ah&mdash;other, at the Crossed Keys.&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>&#8220;The Crossed Keys!&#8221; echoed Ben, his eyes
opening wide.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, to be sure,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;The
Crossed Keys Inn&mdash;where we sit at the present
moment.&#8221;</p>

SCALDING WATER PLAY THEIR PARTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment Ben Cooper was so startled
that he could not speak, and his astonishment
was as plain in his face as in his manner. It
was perhaps fortunate for him that a turmoil
in the room took Bleekwood&#8217;s attention from
him, otherwise he would have undoubtedly
attracted that person&#8217;s attention in a way that
he would not have cared to do.</p>

<p>The turmoil grew louder, high voices became
higher; the inn people were clustering
about in a fright; but still Ben gave it no
attention. His brain was so busy with some
truths which had just dawned upon him, and
for the time he knew nothing else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beware of a man named Seaforth, and of
the Crossed Keys,&#8221; had been the warning of
Johnson Quinsey. And within a very few
hours afterward the lad had been mistaken for
Seaforth, had been directed to a place which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
turned out to be an inn called the &#8220;Crossed
Keys,&#8221; and Bleekwood, the man whom Seaforth
was apparently to meet, had mistaken
Paddy Burk for Ben himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now let me get it clear in my mind,&#8221; was
the boy&#8217;s thought. &#8220;There is some sort of a
plan against me by Hawkins and his confederates;
a part of this was heard in some chance
way by Johnson Quinsey. This scout, Seaforth,
is a friend to the enemies of General Washington;
and he was the man sent for to ride to
York to-night; of that I am confident. One
other was to bear him company; he was to
have the selection of that other, and I am
convinced that it was to have been I. But, as
it chanced, he was gone when his orders came;
and by a still greater chance, I was selected in
his place. And, now, here I am face to face
with the agent of the plotters, if not one of
them; and he, not knowing Seaforth except
by name, thinks I am he. And poor Paddy,
who stands so innocently beyond there, is
placed in the danger that should be mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>But his attention was drawn from Paddy at
that instant by an increase in the disturbance
before mentioned. All eyes were turned in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
the direction of the uproar, and well they
might, for never before was there so much
noise by one person. It was a gigantic young
man with an inflamed face and a reckless air;
he seemed possessed by alternate spirits of
destruction, mirth and combat. First he
would lift a heavy oaken chair and dash it to
pieces against the stout walls; then, as though
highly amused at his own performance, he
would burst into a gale of laughter; and a
moment later, his humor changing, he would
brandish his enormous fists in the faces of
those nearest him and dare them to grapple
or fisticuff with him. But all declined the
invitation with much promptness, at which
the young giant resumed his work of destruction
once more.</p>

<p>Finally, unable to bear it longer, the
landlord approached.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this, sir?&#8221; demanded he with an
air of assurance, which he, perhaps, was far
from feeling. &#8220;Must you break up my furnishing,
young gentleman? Has a madness
come upon you that you should do the like?
Have done, sir; have done at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young giant glared at him; here at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
length, so it seemed, was one who would oppose
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, so you are there, are you, mine host
of the Crossed Keys?&#8221; cried he, delighted at
the prospect of having some one at whom to
level his humor and perhaps receive his blows.
&#8220;And so you object to my amusing myself,
eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I object to your destroying my property,
sir,&#8221; said the host. &#8220;It is a wanton injustice
to do such a thing in a peaceable house.
Have done, sir. The damage already here
will cost a pretty penny!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, would so brawny a fellow as yourself
cry out about an injustice?&#8221; demanded
the giant. &#8220;Would you prefer to make a
complaint of the tongue rather than one of
the hand? Surely a fist like that of yours
was made for brisker work than you do.
Come then,&#8221; and here he shattered another
chair upon the oaken floor. &#8220;You will do
something to prevent the like again, I&#8217;m
sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not given to the bandying of blows,&#8221;
said the landlord, who for all his bulk was soft
and ill conditioned. &#8220;It is not my trade, sir;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
I ask you if you be a gentleman to cease your
mad behavior.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with this mild admonition, the host,
seeing his obstreperous guest advancing toward
him, retreated down the room in the direction
of the table at which sat Ben Cooper and
Master Bleekwood. The latter turned nervously
to the boy, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;One always meets with conduct such as
this in a crowded inn. It is most unseemly
and objectionable; and its effect upon my
weakened nervous state is ill, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the landlord&#8217;s retreat was a trifle hasty,
the advance of the giant did not come up with
him; he had entered the kitchen and closed
the door by the time his pursuer had covered
half the distance, and so the huge young man
leaned against a table and held forth as to
cowardice.</p>

<p>&#8220;He who will not risk his great carcass in
defense of his property is a poltroon,&#8221; delivered
he, loudly. &#8220;If any were to do the like by
me, I&#8217;d fight him if I had but one leg to stand
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>As it chanced the table against which he
leaned was that of Bleekwood and Ben; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
as he continued to volley forth, the former
touched him upon the arm and ventured
mildly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask your pardon, sir, but if you have no
very serious objections would you select another
leaning place?&#8221; And as the giant
turned and glared down at him, he hastily
continued as though in explanation: &#8220;You
see, your present attitude is somewhat interfering
with my comfort, and as I am a person
of no very robust health I must look to it that
my comfort is not taken from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the giant, &#8220;and so you must
look to your comfort, must you? Well, Mr.
Longshanks, I&#8217;ll see what I can do to aid you
in that.&#8221; And with that he stretched out one
huge hand, gripped Master Bleekwood and
dragged him to his feet. &#8220;Your comfort
must not be interfered with, do you say, my
gentleman?&#8221; demanded the giant. &#8220;Ah,
well, let us see what can be done to add to it,
for one like you should be coddled, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; spoke Master Bleekwood, not making
a move in his captor&#8217;s grasp, &#8220;this is most
undignified. Release your grasp upon my
shoulder, I beg of you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>&#8220;Not until you have asked my pardon upon
your knees,&#8221; said the giant. &#8220;I feel, good sir,
that I have been most grossly insulted, and
if this is not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly Master Bleekwood&#8217;s whole aspect
changed; with a tremendous wrench he freed
himself from the grasp of the other, and
with a deftness that could only have been
gained by long experience, he spun about and
planted a half dozen short, powerful blows
upon the man&#8217;s face. With the blood streaming
from mouth and nose, and roaring with
pain, the young giant steadied himself for a
rush. But before he could make a move a
door behind him opened, and a strong girl
with red hair and a freckled, good-looking
face stepped into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gintlemen, gintlemen!&#8221; she cried, with
a brogue as thick as Paddy Burk&#8217;s own, &#8220;will
you give over your noise? Sure, how in the
world can a poor wounded officer on his way
home to his ould father get a wink of sleep if
you go on like this? Is it a bedlam instead of
a decent inn that we&#8217;ve got into?&#8221; Then
her quick, bright eye noting that the giant
was responsible for most of the turmoil, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
marched sturdily to his side. &#8220;Young gintleman,&#8221;
she continued, &#8220;will you close your
mouth and give over your great talk? Is it
do harm by your noise to a soldier, who got
his hurts in his country&#8217;s cause, you&#8217;d be
doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man turned his inflamed face
upon her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take yourself off, you kitchen wench,&#8221; he
growled. &#8220;Hold your tongue, while I grind
the bones of yon pretty gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the freckle-faced lass was not to be
daunted by a savage tone of voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it me you call a kitchen wench?&#8221; she
demanded, her arms akimbo. &#8220;And I&#8217;m to
hold my tongue as well, am I? Well, sir, I&#8217;ll
not do that, but,&#8221; and with a swift movement
she suited the action to the words, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take
hold of your ear for you, you villain of the
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taken aback, the giant glowered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let go, you virago!&#8221; he shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down!&#8221; ordered she, shoving him
into a chair. &#8220;And stay there! Faith, it&#8217;s
ashamed of yourself you ought to be, to be
after raising such a pother about the place.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
Keep quiet now, for if it&#8217;s again I have to come
out to you, it&#8217;s the back of my hand I&#8217;ll give
you, so it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that and a whisk of her short
skirts she was gone. And as she departed the
landlord reappeared armed with a stout staff
and backed by a number of his ablest waiters
and hostlers, also armed. But the blows of
Master Bleekwood, and the fearless front of the
Irish girl had had their effect upon the giant,
for he kept his chair quietly enough; what remained
of his humor was vented in a low muttering,
the purport of which was not intelligible.</p>

<p>And after things were fairly quiet once
more, Ben Cooper spoke to Bleekwood.</p>

<p>&#8220;It were a thousand pities, sir, that your
health is not what it should be. Otherwise
you would be able to resent such affronts as
that fellow put upon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad spoke drily; there was a suspicion
of mockery in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, as for that,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;I have
often thought that health is a thing greatly to
be desired. But it is a boon not meant for
me, that I sadly fear. If I were possessed of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
it, I might be able to do some little thing to
protect myself; but as it is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and he
shook his head and sighed.</p>

<p>This, then, was a favorite pose of the melancholy
Bleekwood; he desired to seem backward
in any matter requiring physical effort,
and a nervous weakling in things calling for
courage.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; thought the lad who sat near him,
&#8220;he is a pretty fighter enough. Indeed, I
would say that it would go extremely hard
with any but the best who faced him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It were well that I could provide myself
with a half dozen strong fellows to-night, so
that there might be no missing the point of
our efforts,&#8221; said Bleekwood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah; and so there are some others?&#8221; said
Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure. It would require one much
more stalwart than I to venture upon a matter
of this sort, alone. No, no! I can plan
and I can direct others as to what to do; but
to engage in the matter in other ways&mdash;no!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Master Hawkins is not here, by any
chance?&#8221; said Ben, with a studied carelessness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>The cadaverous one shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he, &#8220;he remains at York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Master Sugden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is also there. Ah,&#8221; regretfully, &#8220;they
have the skilled portions of the work to do,
and while I try not to envy them, I cannot
help a slight feeling somewhat akin to it.
The Marquis,&#8221; in a dreamy sort of way,
&#8220;makes a splendid companion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Marquis?&#8221; questioned Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Marquis de Lafayette, that is.&#8221;
Master Bleekwood clasped his hands behind
his head and fixed his eyes upon the ceiling;
and his aspect was that of one who sees
pleasant things. &#8220;A splendid companion,
indeed,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;So much of the spirit
of youth, so much dash and enterprise and
the desire for adventure and experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is with Tobias Hawkins, then?&mdash;and
Master Sugden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At York,&#8221; replied Bleekwood. &#8220;At
York. The Marquis is no idiot. He has
been here long enough to see how matters
stand. Youth seeks success, not failure.
And Washington is not the winning general.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Ben Cooper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>His eyes went about the room, seeking
Paddy; but the Irish lad was nowhere to be
seen. Indeed, now that he thought about the
matter, he had not seen his friend since a few
moments before the now subdued giant had
begun his destruction of the furniture.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see my friend,&#8221; said he to the man
opposite him.</p>

<p>Bleekwood took his eyes from the ceiling.
&#8220;There were one or two of my fellows close
at hand a few minutes ago, and I signaled
them that he was the person they were waiting
for. I rather think,&#8221; languidly glancing
here and there, &#8220;that they have managed to
draw him away somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the full knowledge strong upon him
as to what this meant, Ben Cooper was
startled. But he did not permit it to be seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were speaking of the Marquis,&#8221; said
he, insinuatingly. &#8220;But, to be candid, I do
not see just why he should be bothered about.
He is but a boy&mdash;he has no experience as a
soldier. If Master Hawkins desires to attract
officers from Washington&#8217;s army, why does he
not make an effort upon Greene, or Sterling,
or Wayne?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>But Bleekwood waved one long, thin hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Greene and Wayne and Sterling are all
very well,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Most excellent generals,
every one. But we are not seeking
generals, my dear sir. No, no! far from it.
We have generals a-plenty. What is required
is the influence that will count across
the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Across the sea?&#8221; said Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;In France, to be more explicit. Master
Silas Dean and Master Benjamin Franklin
have done much to arouse interest there in
the American cause. And now that a great
victory has been won at Saratoga, France will
see her way clear to taking definite steps in
the matter. If the French king sends over a
fleet and an army, which he will now no
doubt do, his stated preference to Congress as
to what leader his commander shall deal with
will have a powerful bearing upon Congress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Master Hawkins thinks that to win
Lafayette to his side will turn the favor of
France toward General Gates?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has some such notion&mdash;and a most
excellent one it is, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the Marquis is not in the king&#8217;s good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
graces. He ran away here to America against
the king&#8217;s wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The king was forced to forbid his going
because of political reasons. But, secretly, he
was delighted when he made safely away;
for France desired some one to overlook conditions
here and speak the truth concerning
them. Another thing, the gallant conduct
of the Marquis in sacrificing everything to
take up the cause of liberty aroused great
enthusiasm in Paris. They rave over him;
the queen and the other great ladies sent him
offerings of their admiration. Lafayette is
but a lad, it&#8217;s true,&#8221; spoke Bleekwood, &#8220;but
that faction which holds his support will have
a heavy advantage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Master Hawkins is a far-seeing man,&#8221; said
Ben, thoughtfully. &#8220;There are few points in
the game that escape him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are none,&#8221; claimed the cadaverous
Bleekwood, in high admiration. &#8220;He misses
nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>And no sooner had these words been uttered
than there again came a great noise from somewhere
within the inn. Voices were lifted,
steel clashed upon steel, and footsteps rushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
to and fro. Thoughts of Paddy came to Ben,
and he leaped up, drawing his pistol. But
the shouts changed in tone, the blows ceased;
but the rushing footsteps increased; then a
door was flung open and a half dozen rough
looking fellows, swords in hand, came pouring
into the public room, cries of fear upon
their lips. Behind them, her blue eyes shining
with indignation and bearing a huge
kettle of scalding water in her hands, was the
red-haired Irish lass who had subdued the
roystering giant a short time before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out with you, you thieves,&#8221; cried this
redoubtable person; &#8220;out upon you! Is it
kill a decent boy you&#8217;d be doing? Out of my
reach now, or I&#8217;ll scald the dirty hides off
every one of you. Arrah, don&#8217;t be threatening
me now, for sorra the bit is Molly Hayes
afraid of your bodkins, you blackguards. Go
along now, or I&#8217;ll dash every drop I have here
into your ugly faces.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as she stood there in the doorway, the
steaming vessel held aloft, fronting the scowling
men, Ben, to his great relief, saw peering
over her shoulder the grinning face of Paddy
Burk.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />


<small>IN WHICH BEN RECEIVES A LETTER AND RIDES<br />
TOWARDS YORK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment it seemed as though the
group of ruffians might take heart and fly at
Molly Hayes, despite the scalding reception it
was in her power to give them. But before
they could fully make up their minds, the
landlord and his fellows hurried up.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s to do now?&#8221; demanded the worthy
host, bewildered at this fresh outbreak. &#8220;Is
the house never to be at rest? How, sirs,&#8221; to
the men, &#8220;with your swords out&mdash;and at a
woman. For shame! And you, mistress,&#8221;
to the girl, &#8220;will nothing do but flourishing
one of my coppers in the faces of my guests?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your guests!&#8221; The girl put the vessel
upon the floor, and wiped her arms with her
apron. &#8220;And pretty guests they are for any
one to have around about them.&#8221; She pointed
to the room which she had just left. &#8220;Upon
a bed there is the lieutenant, as you know,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
and there I sits by his side, giving him his
medicine and his small bite to eat. And then
open bursts the window like a thunderbolt
and into the room they leaped, their swords
in their hands, like a lot of robbers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d never have bothered you if it hadn&#8217;t
been for him,&#8221; and one of the men pointed at
Paddy, who still stood all agrin behind the
girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take shame for you, a parcel of thieves,
each with a sword in his fist, all after the life
of one poor boy. No wonder he jumped
through the window into the room to get
away from you, and small blame to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>But diplomatically the landlord, without
any inquiries into the cause of the outbreak,
soothed everybody; the result was that the
men put up their weapons and grumblingly
took seats at a table far down the room, while
Molly Hayes and Paddy Burk disappeared
into the room from which they had emerged
a few moments before.</p>

<p>The cadaverous Master Bleekwood had
regarded this scene with scornful eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The clumsy rascals,&#8221; he now said to Ben,
&#8220;they have ruined their chances. I might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
have expected such.&#8221; He arose to his feet.
&#8220;Do you,&#8221; said he, &#8220;try and quiet any
suspicions which your friend may have; I will
have a quiet word with these fellows of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben sat at the table trying to collect his
thoughts which had been badly scattered by
the events of the last few moments; then,
more by chance than anything else, he saw
the door which had closed in Paddy Burk
open a trifle and a hand beckon him into the
room beyond. He went to the door and
passed through; Paddy Burk immediately
closed it behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; said Paddy, and his face had
lost none of the grin of a short time before,
&#8220;why, then, this is the great night entirely.
Did you have a fair view of it all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so,&#8221; replied Ben. &#8220;But, tell
me, how did it come about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As I were standing watching the landlord
and the rampaging fellow a while back,&#8221; said
Paddy, &#8220;a gossoon comes up to me and begins
a bit of a discussion. I&#8217;ll never know how it
came about, but soon we were head over ears
in a quarrel; and then he invited me to the
outside where we could settle the matter without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
further words. Out I goes with him,
behind the inn; but sorra a blow was struck
before the rest of them made at me. So I
slipped open the window nearest me and dove
in with the lot of them after me. The rest, I
think, you know already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a-plenty it is to know, faith,&#8221; said
the voice of Molly Hayes. &#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s fair
ashamed of myself I am for making such a
botheration as I have to-night. But a body
must not allow himself to be imposed upon.
And above all, the lieutenant must not be
disturbed.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the girl spoke Ben for the first time saw
a pale young man, with a bandage about
his head, propped up on a sort of couch.
There was something familiar in his aspect,
but Ben did not recognize him until he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and have I changed so
much, Cooper, that you do not remember
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Claflin!&#8221; Ben advanced and
took the wasted hand held out to him. &#8220;Why,
can it be you, indeed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All that&#8217;s left of me,&#8221; said Lieutenant
Claflin with a wan smile. &#8220;I happened to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
have been sent to the neighborhood of the
Highland forts some little time ago; and on
the day the British made their attack, I was
at Fort Clinton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you badly hurt?&#8221; asked Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;It could have been worse,&#8221; said Claflin.
&#8220;But it was bad enough as it was. However,
I am now on the mend, and Molly, here, is
taking me home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Home?&#8221; Ben looked puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, of course, you have not heard;
but since the army of Lord Howe has been in
the possession of Philadelphia, my father has
changed his place of residence to the town of
York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many have done the like,&#8221; said Ben
Cooper. &#8220;My own father has been forced
from his house at Germantown and is now at
Reading.&#8221; They discussed the situation for a
time and then Ben said: &#8220;You must have
suffered great hardship in the long journey
across the Jerseys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so much as you might think,&#8221; replied
Lieutenant Claflin with a laugh. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
Molly, wife to a fine fellow who is a sergeant
in the artillery, Hayes by name; and she&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
stood between me and all the hard knocks I
would otherwise have had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrah, then, sir,&#8221; said Molly Hayes, &#8220;is
it leaving you to die I&#8217;d be doing? And you
with the young sister and old father you&#8217;ve
so often told me about! Anybody could see
by the way you speak of them, sir, that it&#8217;s
the world they think of you; and if you&#8217;d
a-died what would they have done at all, at
all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure enough, Molly,&#8221; said young Claflin,
soberly; &#8220;sure enough. Well, they will
have you to thank when we get to York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s little enough they have to thank
me for!&#8221; protested Molly. &#8220;Sure, anybody
would have done the like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, nobody but you made any attempt
at it,&#8221; said Claflin. &#8220;You must know,&#8221; and
the speaker turned to Ben, &#8220;that Molly is a
great girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I should think,&#8221; laughed Ben, &#8220;after
the few exhibitions of her prowess which I
have witnessed to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Molly laughed and flushed at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrah, don&#8217;t be judging me from that,
young gintleman,&#8221; she pleaded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; smiled Claflin, &#8220;subduing a
bully and putting to flight a crew of murderous
wretches like those a while ago are
scarcely performances that will do her complete
justice. Now at Fort Clinton, for example&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, lieutenant,&#8221; commanded young
Mistress Hayes. But he never heard her.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the enemy had hemmed us in so
that there was scarce time for the hindmost to
make safely away, who remembered that there
was a loaded cannon left unfired? Who was
it that went back, in the peril of her very life,
applied the match and discharged it in their
very faces as they came rushing on, shouting
in triumph? Who but Molly Hayes, herself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The lieutenant is a kind-hearted young
man,&#8221; Molly explained to Ben. &#8220;And he do
be always giving more credit to people than is
their due.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can plainly see that you&#8217;re more than an
ordinary person, Mistress Hayes,&#8221; smiled Ben,
&#8220;and so I will not take even your own word
against yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so laughing and chatting they passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
a half hour; at the end of this time Paddy
Burk and Molly Hayes and Ben and Lieutenant
Claflin became immersed in more momentous
things.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father,&#8221; the young officer had said,
&#8220;does a great deal of entertaining, even at
York.&#8221;</p>

<p>This remark was brought out in his insisting
that Ben make them a visit while in the
town. And instantly upon hearing it, Ben&#8217;s
face took on an expression of much seriousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Philadelphia,&#8221; said he, &#8220;all the notables
flocked to your father&#8217;s entertainments.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lieutenant laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they do so at York, if what I hear be
so,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>From that moment Ben grew more and
more thoughtful; it were as though he were
revolving an important something in his
mind. After a little the lieutenant noticed
this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said he. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just thinking,&#8221; answered Ben, &#8220;of
a small chain of incidents which happened
to-night, and also of some larger things, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
took place some time ago, but which are intimately
connected with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; proceeded Ben Cooper, &#8220;I have
been wondering if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If&mdash;what?&#8221; inquired Claflin, as he paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I scarcely think you will understand unless
I tell you all that has happened,&#8221; said
Ben. &#8220;So if you will listen&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; directed the young lieutenant.</p>

<p>So with that Ben began the story of Tobias
Hawkins at the point where that gentleman&#8217;s
path had first crossed his own; step by step
he followed it until he reached the doings of
that very night. And when he had done the
lieutenant drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, in amazement, &#8220;this is
indeed a tale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not done even yet,&#8221; said Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see that,&#8221; replied the other. &#8220;I
can see that readily enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The story of Tobias Hawkins is not yet
finished,&#8221; said Ben. &#8220;Nor will it ever be, to
the satisfaction of true believers in liberty, at
any rate&mdash;until several links are added to the
chain by a hand other than his own.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>&#8220;You have some sort of a plan,&#8221; cried the
other, sitting more upright upon his couch.
&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said Ben. And so, with their
heads close together and their voices pitched
low, they sat for the better part of another
hour. And when they had finished, Lieutenant
Claflin grasped Ben&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do what I can,&#8221; declared he. &#8220;And my
father and sister will do the same. If success
to your plan can be won by effort upon our
parts, depend upon it that we will do our best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is all I ask,&#8221; said Ben.</p>

<p>After a few moments more the latter arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must make haste,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Paddy
and I are on our way to York now, and must
lose no more time. However, I will see you
before a great while.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so with good-byes for the injured lieutenant
and his nurse, Ben and the Irish lad
made their way out by a rear door.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be just as well,&#8221; said Ben, &#8220;if we
avoid the attention of Master Bleekwood and
his friends. Our way is a long one, and we&#8217;ll
be the better for not having an enemy in our
rear.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>Their horses were found where they had
tied them; they mounted silently and proceeded
upon their way. Nothing further was
encountered upon the road; and after a wearying
ride they finally reached York to learn
that their services were not in demand.</p>

<p>&#8220;A curt reception,&#8221; said Ben, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;It have a queer look, so it have,&#8221; said
Paddy, scratching his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;In that it agrees with many other things
which we have encountered of late,&#8221; spoke
Ben Cooper. &#8220;And it agrees entirely with
the idea I formed some time back regarding
this summons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That we were never really wanted&mdash;here.
It was Seaforth and I who were wanted, at
the Crossed Keys&mdash;Seaforth the decoy, and I
the victim.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as they were sufficiently rested they
returned to the American camp, and made
their report. However, Ben said nothing as
to what had happened upon the road, and
warned Paddy to do likewise.</p>

<p>Not long after this the forts which guarded
the passage of the Delaware fell before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
assault of the British. A pressure was
brought upon Washington to attack Philadelphia,
which he resisted with all his might.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall the army of the north alone win
victories?&#8221; was the cry. &#8220;Can we not strike
even a blow with the army of the Schuylkill?
Give us a general who will fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>With at least outward calm, Washington
faced this fresh outburst against him. He
knew that the British defenses were too
powerful to be taken at that time, and he
refused to dash his small force against their
bristling lines.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would mean only destruction,&#8221; said he,
and the greater part of his officers agreed with
him.</p>

<p>His enemies, always at work, about this
time succeeded in altering the form of the
Board of War&mdash;and most significant of all,
General Gates was made president of it.
Mifflin was also one of the five who composed
the board, which had the direction of military
affairs in its hands; and it was plain to be
seen that these two were intended to be the
master spirits of the war. At once the board
began its work. Two inspector-generals were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
appointed; and one of these was Conway, who
was given the rank of major-general, in the
teeth of Washington&#8217;s plainly expressed opinion
as to the man&#8217;s unfitness.</p>

<p>Seeing that nothing was to be gained by
keeping the field in the dead of winter,
Washington now prepared to hut his army
at Valley Forge, about twenty miles from
Philadelphia. At once another cry burst
upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why have we raised and officered an
army?&#8221; was the burden of this complaint.
&#8220;Its purpose is to protect us from our
enemies. And to do this it should keep the
field.&#8221;</p>

<p>The brave heart of the commander-in-chief
burned in his breast at this; his gallant fellows
were without shoes, blankets or clothing
to protect them from the icy winds. Their
tents were thin and gave them little shelter;
and to ask men so circumstanced to keep the
field was heartless and inhuman. So in spite
of the storm of protest, the ragged army took
up its gloomy march through the snow to
Valley Forge. Cold, bitter weather was upon
them; the naked feet of many left bloody footprints<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
in the snow. And yet, while this suffering
was being undergone, great quantities
of clothing, shoes and woolen stockings were
lying at intervals along distant roadsides,
rotting for want of teams, supplied by those
in charge of such things, to cart them where
they were held in such pressing need. Washington&#8217;s
enemies were now in charge of such
supplies, and this was another blow leveled at
him&mdash;a blow calculated to break his high heart
and cause him to throw up his commission.</p>

<p>Inch by inch the plotters had forced General
Schuyler from his command in the north;
successful there, they were now using the same
methods upon Washington. But through it
all he stood unflinching and unmoved save
by the suffering of his soldiers. The depths
of the conspirators&#8217; meanness was equaled
only by the depths of his courage; the obstacles
erected in his path, the pitfalls dug for
his feet were meant for one whose patience
and patriotism could be measured. But in a
splendid soul like that of General Washington,
these virtues are unmeasured; and so he passed
on serene and unmoved, his calm eyes fixed
steadily upon the future.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>It was while the naked army shivered in
the midst of that most rigorous of winters at
Valley Forge that Ben Cooper one day received
a letter. It read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come at once. Everything now ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>A glance at the signature showed that it was
&#8220;Claflin&#8221;; then instantly he went to headquarters
and requested leave to visit York at
once. As the young rider was possessed of
the confidence of those in command, this was
granted without delay. Immediately his
horse was saddled and eagerly mounted; and
away he went over the winter road.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />


<small>TELLS HOW LAFAYETTE ASTONISHED GENERAL<br />
GATES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Claflins occupied a fine old house overhung
by giant elms; and in the drawing-room
of this Ben was greeted by Lieutenant
Claflin and his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray you sit down and take the chill of
the road out of your bones,&#8221; said the old
gentleman, placing a chair for the boy.</p>

<p>A fine fire of billets was roaring away in the
fireplace; Ben sat down with the others, and
in a very few moments their talk was all of
the subject nearest their hearts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such villainy!&#8221; said old Mr. Claflin. &#8220;I
never dreamed of such.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have approached the point of it, at
least,&#8221; said the lieutenant. &#8220;As you told me
that night at the Crossed Keys, an attempt is
to be made to draw young Lafayette away
from General Washington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have learned something of this definitely,
then?&#8221; asked Ben, eagerly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>&#8220;Yes. According to your plan I have used
all my time since being here in convincing
them that I am not averse to their views,
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Mr. Claflin gestured his distaste.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would there had been another way of
doing this,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I have no liking for
double dealing in any form.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; said the young lieutenant. &#8220;But
to deceive them was perhaps the only way to
success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Without a doubt,&#8221; said Ben. &#8220;Such men
as these refuse to fight in the open, or in such
a manner that one can deal them a hearty
blow. One must adopt their own methods if
they are to be fought at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you are right,&#8221; sighed old Mr.
Claflin. &#8220;Fight fire with fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have come to consider us as sharing
their views,&#8221; spoke the lieutenant, &#8220;and have
grown less and less averse to speaking their
minds before us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The house is alive with them,&#8221; said old
Mr. Claflin. &#8220;And never such a crew of sordid
conspirators did I encounter anywhere.
They mask their desires, to be sure, behind a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
pretense that what they advocate is for the
country&#8217;s good. But,&#8221; with a gesture of
contempt, &#8220;not for a moment do they lose
sight of their own personal ends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lafayette has been offered an independent
command,&#8221; said Lieutenant Claflin. &#8220;An
expedition is to be organized against Canada;
if he will accept he is to be placed at the head
of it, with General Conway second in command.
According to their plans, the latter,
by his superior experience and natural military
talents, would soon assume the real
command.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is supposed to have two results.
The Marquis will be drawn away from the
immediate influence of Washington, and the
favor shown him by those opposed to the
commander-in-chief will bind him to them
permanently.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben sat with his chin resting in his hand,
his eyes staring into the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;A separate command,&#8221; said he, musingly.
&#8220;And not only that, but a command that is
to be pushed forward to immediate conquest.
The conquering of Canada has been the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
ambition of many of our generals. And to
have an opportunity of doing what so fearless
and able a soldier as Arnold failed to do, is a
very great temptation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think, then,&#8221; quavered Mr. Claflin,
&#8220;that Lafayette will not be strong enough to
resist?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I think just the reverse of
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Claflin looked at Ben keenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;From your manner I would say that you
know something that we do not know,&#8221; said
he.</p>

<p>Ben did not reply to this, but continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;If it were preferment Lafayette sought, he
would have remained at home, for there all
the honors he could desire were at his hand.
No; his ambition is much higher than mere
personal advantage; and the command of an
army will not tempt him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is to meet them here,&#8221; said the
young lieutenant. &#8220;They are to have a dinner,
a private dinner&mdash;and then they are to
spread their net.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When is this to be?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>&#8220;To-night,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;Lafayette is
already arrived in York, I understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be like the meeting of a band
of low conspirators,&#8221; said old Mr. Claflin,
thumping the stick, which he always carried,
upon the floor. &#8220;If I could, I would
take them all, and pitch them into the
road.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Claflin laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Patience, father, patience. That, though
perhaps in another form, may come later.&#8221;</p>

<p>That day and the next passed, not without
great anxiety to the Claflins. The possible
winning away of Lafayette from Washington
and the consequent bestowal of the expected
favor of France upon his enemies was a matter
of great consequence to them, for they, indeed,
had the welfare of the nation at heart. But
Ben Cooper did not join in their nervous talk;
he remained very calm and thoughtful, though
as the time for the meeting of the conspirators
drew nearer, he displayed an eagerness that
was noticeable.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Claflin looked at the long table
with its spotless napery, shining china and
fine old silver plate; the candles burned in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
high candlesticks at regular intervals, and a
chair was placed for each expected guest.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one for you,&#8221; said he to Ben. &#8220;I
thought you&#8217;d like to hear what goes forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; spoke Lieutenant Claflin, hastily.
&#8220;That would be impossible; how could we
explain the presence of a stranger at such a
time as this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Far easier to explain the presence of a
stranger than to explain mine,&#8221; laughed Ben.
&#8220;You forget that my very good friends, Tobias
Hawkins and Master Sugden, are both to be
here. What would they say did they perceive
me seated opposite them?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Claflin struck his hands together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said he in comical vexation, &#8220;I
had forgotten that entirely. To be sure!
What could I have been thinking of? You
are, really, the very last person in the world
whom they should find here.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, the old gentleman had got it into
his head that Ben should be a witness to the
proceedings; and realizing that he could not
show himself, he set about contriving a secret
means of his seeing and hearing what took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
place. There was a small apartment adjoining
the supper and reception rooms; and over the
communicating doors of each there was a narrow
transom. These the old gentleman had
opened and a thin curtain was drawn across
them, making them the best possible place of
observation.</p>

<p>Ben was at once placed in this room, and
with a book and a candle by the fire, began to
while away the time. No great space elapsed
before the knocker sounded, telling him that
some of the guests had arrived. At once he
put out his candle, and sat in the semi-darkness
beside the fire, waiting.</p>

<p>Several persons were shown into the reception
room, and as the door closed behind the
man servant who had admitted them, their
voices came plainly to the ears of the waiting
lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Br-r-r-r! A cold enough night, Sugden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For all intents and purposes. But the
season is none too cold for Price to make his
way here from Phila&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush! It will be just as well not to speak
too loudly of such things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben noiselessly arose, mounted a chair, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
peered through the curtains at the transom.
The two men stood before the fire, and their
voices were pitched in a low key.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been something of importance
to bring him all this distance in such
weather,&#8221; suggested Sugden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Howe has made a most excellent stroke,&#8221;
said Hawkins. Then, though Ben listened
eagerly, the voice sank so low as to be almost
unintelligible. &#8220;General Charles Lee is to be
exchanged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; said Sugden, &#8220;at this time?
Surely not. Why, he is regarded as a military
genius by the rebels.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hawkins laughed lowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is regarded so&mdash;yes. But is he really
such? Howe does not think so, at any
rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the Americans but believe in him, that
will be enough to give them heart. It should
be Howe&#8217;s plan to keep them plunged in their
present discouragement as deeply as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Tobias Hawkins laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said he, &#8220;General Howe has a
more complete plan than you think. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
would you say&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; here he bent forward and
whispered a few words in Sugden&#8217;s ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; almost cried the latter gentleman.
&#8220;Is it possible?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Price tells me that it is a fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then, in that case, we can even lose
in the little affair of to-night, and still do no
great harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the face of this news,&#8221; smiled Tobias
Hawkins, &#8220;the armies of France can support
the armies of Washington if they see fit. It
will make little or no difference. But for all
that, let us make doubly sure, and win over
this young Frenchman, now that we have him
so nearly in our hands. I have found, by
long experience, that it is not good policy to
miss a single point, even though one apparently
does not need it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation continued, but in so low
a key as to escape Ben&#8217;s ear. However, in a
short time the other guests began to arrive,
and when Lafayette, bubbling over with boyish
good nature, finally put in an appearance,
they entered the supper room and were soon
doing the most complete justice to Mr. Claflin&#8217;s
supper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>&#8220;A better cook,&#8221; declared General Conway,
&#8220;none could find in all Pennsylvania.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a scarcity of cooks in your country,
to be sure,&#8221; said Lafayette, smilingly to
General Gates. &#8220;But our good host,&#8221; bowing
to that gentleman, &#8220;seems to have found one,
at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After the camp, gentlemen,&#8221; said Mr.
Claflin, &#8220;the food has an unaccustomed relish,
that is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour passed in laughter, toasting, jest
and feasting. Young Lafayette seemed vastly
delighted with everything; and more than
once Ben, through the transom curtains, saw
Conway and Gates exchange meaning smiles.
Then by degrees the conversation assumed a
more sober hue; the army, its condition and
prospects became the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said General Gates, at
length, &#8220;since Congress saw fit to appoint me
the head of the Board of War, I have conceived,
as you all know, a project which, if it
can be carried out successfully, will strike
terror to the hearts of our enemies and at one
blow put them at the defense. I refer to the
conquest of Canada.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>A storm of approval greeted this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gates! Gates!&#8221; was the cry. &#8220;A toast!
A toast!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the general stayed them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We required a commander for this enterprise,&#8221;
said he; &#8220;a commander of spirit, of
dash and judgment. We looked about for
such a one, and we had not far to look.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again came the clatter of approval; but
once more Gates stopped them.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was but one such officer at hand,&#8221;
said the general, continuing, &#8220;and to him the
command was offered. I believe in encouraging
genius&mdash;though to repress it seems more
the practice in this army. Too long has this
brilliant young soldier of whom I speak,&#8221; and
his gaze went to Lafayette, &#8220;been held in the
background. Knowing the past as some of us
do,&#8221; here his eyes went to Mifflin and Conway,
&#8220;we realize the chagrin that must now
fill the breast of one who seeks to keep all the
glory for himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>A thin hiss ran from lip to lip at this
picture of official selfishness. Gates proceeded:</p>

<p>&#8220;The offer of the command of the Canadian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
expedition was made the Marquis de Lafayette.
And we now ask him whether he accepts or
no.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lafayette arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do accept,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I accept with the
utmost gratitude. The command is a most
important one, and I shall do my utmost to
bring it to success.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a chorus of cheers; the conspirators
gathered about him, offering their
congratulations.</p>

<p>&#8220;A toast!&#8221; cried a voice. &#8220;Gates! Gates!
A toast.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time a number of others took up the
cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;A toast, Marquis, a toast!&#8221; they demanded.</p>

<p>All eyes went from Lafayette to Gates. It
was plain that the latter was the person to be
toasted; and he stood smilingly expectant.
Lafayette lifted his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I see by the clock
that the time which I had to give this delightful
occasion is more than passed. I
must make the first stage of the journey back
to Valley Forge before daybreak.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>&#8220;A toast! A toast!&#8221; cried the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Lafayette. &#8220;Charge
your glasses, since you insist.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a shout this was done; and all stood
with eyes upon the youthful Frenchman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I give you the
commander-in-chief of the American army&mdash;General
Washington!&#8221;</p>

<p>A silence&mdash;pall-like and complete, fell upon
all; if a writing in letters of fire had appeared
upon the wall their surprise could not have
been more great. For a moment Lafayette
stood regarding them, contempt plain in his
eyes; then he placed his glass upon the table,
and said to Gates:</p>

<p>&#8220;General, I am yours to command whenever
my services are needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with a formal salute, he turned and
stalked from the room, leaving them speechless
with surprise.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />


<small>IN WHICH THE BATTLE OF MONMOUTH IS<br />
LOST AND WON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> winter at Valley Forge was one of
untold suffering. When stout old Baron
Steuben, one of Frederick the Great&#8217;s general
officers, first saw the army of shoeless, naked
and hungry men, he threw up his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nefer,&#8221; he cried, in his broken English,
&#8220;haf I seen such before! Nefer! If an
army was half so wretched in Europe they
would run away&mdash;noddings could hold them.&#8221;</p>

<p>But in time things grew more bearable.
Little by little the higher souls in Congress
made their way against the spirit of intrigue.
The enemies of Washington, after their failure
with Lafayette, relaxed their efforts. Mifflin
resigned his post as head of the commissariat
and Washington&#8217;s tried friend, General Greene,
succeeded him. Food and clothing began to
be fairly plentiful; the spirits of the troops
rose accordingly.</p>

<p>Baron Steuben also succeeded Conway as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
inspector-general, and his constant labors on
the drill ground soon began to bear fruit.
From a wretched rabble, the regiments began
to take on the aspect of discipline and training.</p>

<p>Gates also suddenly fell to some degree in
the favor of his friends in Congress; and
once more he was directed to journey north
and take command of the army in that
region.</p>

<p>The surrender of Burgoyne had been the
cause of the French cabinet&#8217;s concluding a
treaty of alliance with the United States, and
this in turn had been the means of strengthening
Washington&#8217;s hands in the manner
mentioned above.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks,&#8221; said Ezra Prentiss, &#8220;as though
the conspiracy were dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With Gates, Conway and Mifflin all declining
in favor,&#8221; spoke his brother, George,
&#8220;it has that appearance, surely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nat Brewster was also of a similar opinion;
but Ben was not so sure. Only a little while
before, General Charles Lee, for some time a
prisoner in the hands of the British, had been
exchanged for the English General Prescott,
and when he saw this brilliant and erratic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
soldier warmly greeted by Washington and
his officers, Ben&#8217;s heart somehow grew heavy
with fear for the future.</p>

<p>What if Conway and Mifflin and Gates
were out of favor? They were merely instruments
in the hands of the British, through
the machinations of Tobias Hawkins.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Hawkins is still able to plot,&#8221; mused
Ben. &#8220;And that he is somewhere plotting
and laying his snares is sure, for he is not
the one to give up.&#8221; He paused for a little,
staring straight before him, his mind in that
curious state when it seems to have stopped
working, retaining a single picture of a single
thing. Then his thoughts began to flow
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that conversation between Hawkins
and Sugden at Claflin&#8217;s that night! I would
that I had heard more of it. They seemed
to expect something from the exchange of
General Lee. What, I wonder? Can it be
possible that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; but this led to thoughts
that could not be entertained, and so he
banished the matter from his mind.</p>

<p>A council of war held in the camp early in
May had concluded that no blow was to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
attempted against the British until some opportunity
presented itself that would insure
success. Then Howe was recalled and Sir
Henry Clinton took command of the British
army at Philadelphia; and not long after this
signs were shown of an intention to evacuate
the city.</p>

<p>New York was thought to be the point
aimed at; Washington sent some brigades into
the Jerseys to break bridges and otherwise
harass Clinton, should this be the case, but
the main body of his army remained in waiting
to make sure of his enemy&#8217;s movements.</p>

<p>It was on the eighteenth of June that the
British began their movement to a point below
Philadelphia; from there they crossed
the Delaware into New Jersey. Immediately
upon hearing this, Washington broke up his
camp at Valley Forge; sent Arnold, whose
wounded leg did not permit his taking the
field, with a strong force to occupy the city,
and then pushed forward in pursuit of the
enemy.</p>

<p>The Americans crossed the Delaware a little
later, not far from the point where they
had crossed to attack the Hessians a year and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
a half before. Clinton was so slow in his
movements that Washington suspected him of
desiring to get the American force into the
level country, then, by a rapid march, gain
the heights, and so take them at a disadvantage.
Another council of war was held; General
Lee was for holding aloof and merely annoying
the enemy by detachments. As his
military skill was highly regarded, he gained
a majority of the officers to his way of thinking;
and the command went forth that this
style of warfare be begun. However, it was
not at all in favor with the rank and file, and
though they obeyed their officers readily
enough, they were not at all backward in their
criticisms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we a parcel of old women that we
should be afraid to get near enough to the
enemy to come to hand grasps with him?&#8221;
asked a stalwart sergeant of artillery. &#8220;Ah,
I wish, Molly,&#8221; to a red-haired, freckle-faced
young woman, &#8220;that they had had you in the
council instead of General Lee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; said Molly, whom Ben, who
sat near by, at once recognized as the Molly
Hayes he had seen perform so creditably at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
the Crossed Keys, &#8220;if I had it&#8217;s after old Clinton
we&#8217;d a-been long ago. Sure it&#8217;s in the
arms of our lads to give him and his redcoats
a trouncing, so it is, and I&#8217;m for giving it to
them while we have the chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bravo, Molly Pitcher,&#8221; cried a soldier.
&#8220;Good for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m obliged to you for agreeing with me,&#8221;
said Molly, dropping the speaker a satirical
courtesy. &#8220;But I&#8217;d thank you, soldier, not
to call me out of my name, which is Molly
Hayes, and not Molly Pitcher.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pitcher, Molly,&#8221; stated her husband,
the sergeant of artillery, &#8220;is welcome enough
when the lads are thirsty and you bring it to
them full of cool water. So what harm if
they do name you after it? It&#8217;s proud you
should be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorra the bit do I mind it,&#8221; said Molly to
Ben, a little later. &#8220;But it becomes a lady
not to allow them too much familiarity, so it
do.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_326.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap3"><i>&#8220;BRAVO, MOLLY PITCHER!&#8221;</i></p>

<p>Generals Wayne, Greene and Lafayette had
all been of the same opinion as to the proper
means of distressing the enemy. In spite of
the confidently expressed opinions of Lee they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
believed that the rear of the British should be
attacked by a heavy force, while the main
army should be held ready to give general
battle. Washington held the same opinion
and shortly afterward set about carrying it
out. He was no longer in doubt as to Clinton&#8217;s
route; the British were on the road
through Freehold, meaning to embark at
Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>As Lee was opposed to all attack, Washington,
at Lafayette&#8217;s eager solicitation, gave
command of the advance to that gallant young
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said the commander-in-chief, &#8220;the
command is rightfully Lee&#8217;s. However, if he
has no objection, you may have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben carried the request to General Lee.
The latter&#8217;s face when he read the message was
a study to the speculative eyes of the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Imbeciles!&#8221; muttered Lee, who was noted
for his bluntness of speech as well as oddities
of character. &#8220;But let them have their way.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wrote a reply stating that he willingly
relinquished command of the advance. Ben
placed this in his belt, saluted and darted out
to his horse. But he had barely gathered up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
the reins when he heard the ring of hoofs almost
beside him, and glancing around he saw
the strong face of Tobias Hawkins.</p>

<p>For a moment the man looked into the
boy&#8217;s face; and the boy returned the gaze
steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Hawkins, at last, &#8220;so I see you
here, Master Cooper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben nodded, smilingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you surprised? Surely you knew
that your plans at Rising Sun and at the
Crossed Keys both failed.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sour smile crossed the man&#8217;s face, but his
hard eyes did not smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I quite understand,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;But, then, you are difficult to understand at
best. However,&#8221; and there was a low menace
in his tone, &#8220;I may come to understand you
yet. And, mayhap, the understanding is not
far away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben saluted smilingly, shook his rein and
galloped away; but at some little distance he
turned in his saddle and looked back. Hawkins
had dismounted before General Lee&#8217;s tent
and was at that moment upon the point of
entering. At this the lad caught his breath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
sharply. The suspicions aroused by the words
he had heard pass between Hawkins and
Sugden at Claflin&#8217;s returned to him with a
rush.</p>

<p>&#8220;What if, after all, it should be so?&#8221; was
his thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;What if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; but here another thought
occurred to him. &#8220;It makes no difference
just now, at any rate,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;General
Lafayette is to have command of the
advance.&#8221;</p>

<p>He delivered Lee&#8217;s message at headquarters
in all haste; but the delighted young Frenchman
had scarcely rushed away to assume his
post than a horseman dismounted before the
tent of the commander-in-chief and was shown
in. Ben was lingering about under instructions
to wait, as there would probably be work
for him; and he heard the rider announce:</p>

<p>&#8220;From General Lee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Washington at once broke the seal; and as
he read the paper, a cloud overspread his face,
his heavy brows came together in a frown,
and he turned to General Greene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lee has altered his mind,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that he now wants the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
command, after it&#8217;s given to another?&#8221; asked
the astonished Greene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this a quick shock seemed to strike at
Ben Cooper&#8217;s heart. If General Lee was a
traitor&mdash;and the words of Hawkins made him
think so in spite of himself&mdash;what an opportunity
this was to play into the hands of
the British; what an opportunity it was to
deal the cause of liberty a blow from which it
might never recover.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be,&#8221; was the lad&#8217;s instant thought,
&#8220;that Hawkins has had something to do with
this change of mind on the part of General
Lee. Irritated that his advice was not
being followed, the general, who is notoriously
testy, agreed to having Lafayette in command
of the advance. But no sooner had I gone
with this answer, than Hawkins arrived and
pointed out that this course was a mistake for
one in the pay of the British government,
and so instantly Lee altered his mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This situation,&#8221; said General Washington,
&#8220;is a most perplexing one. I do not see how
I can agree to Lee&#8217;s altered fancy without
grievously wounding the feelings of Lafayette.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>But it developed that this could be done
without any difficulty. A sudden altering of
Clinton&#8217;s plans, which threw the weight of
British power into the rear under Cornwallis,
made it necessary for General Washington to
send a reinforcement to his advance. The
brigades of Varnum and Scott were sent under
the headship of General Lee, and he, being
senior officer, was in this way placed in command
of the whole advance.</p>

<p>That night the British encamped near
Monmouth Court House, while the Americans
under Lee lay at Englishtown, five miles
away. Washington and the main body were
three miles to the rear of the advance.</p>

<p>At sundown Washington rode forward; his
practiced eye told him that the British position
was an awkward one to attack; but if they
were allowed to proceed a dozen miles further
their position would be stronger still, for the
heights of Middletown would greatly favor
them. In consequence he made up his mind
to attack at dawn. His orders were given to
Lee in the presence of officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make your disposition for an attack,&#8221; said
Washington. &#8220;Keep your men lying on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
their arms; be ready for action at the shortest
notice.&#8221;</p>

<p>The commander-in-chief then rode back to
the main body, and during the remainder of
the night was busy with preparations for the
coming struggle. At sunrise, Ben Cooper,
who had remained during the night with the
advance, brought news that the British were
in motion. By another rider General Washington
sent a command to Lee to advance and
attack, saying that he was coming on rapidly
to support him. Then the main army was
ordered to discard its blankets, knapsacks and
other heavy equipment so that its progress
should not be retarded.</p>

<p>The Hessian commander, Knyphausen, had
charge of the British advance, which included
all the baggage. And in the early morning
while he slowly made his way into the valley
between Monmouth and Middletown, Clinton
with the fighting men held the camp on the
heights of Freehold. This body did not move
from the latter position until after eight in
the morning, when they also took up the line
of march through Middletown.</p>

<p>It was a region covered by wood and morass,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
and General Lee had no great opportunity to
reconnoiter the enemy; seeing Clinton&#8217;s army
on its march, he told his officers it was only a
detachment. Ordering Wayne with a body
of infantry and a few pieces of artillery to
skirmish in the rear, he set out with the remainder
of his force to, as he said, head the detachment
off. At the same time he sent a rider
to Washington telling him of the movement
and adding that he was confident of success.</p>

<p>The army under Washington was making
excellent time; as they reached Freehold
church a cannon boomed in the distance,
telling them that the fight had opened. At
once the command was given to quicken
the advance. Washington, with his officers
grouped about him, was giving his final instructions.
Ben Cooper and the other young
riders were within call, ready and eager to
bear any messages that might need sending.
The commander-in-chief had just finished his
orders to Greene who was to push on with a
division along a side road and so flank the
enemy, when a farmer mounted upon a plough
horse rode up, wild-eyed and scarcely able to
speak.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>&#8220;They are retreating!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; demanded some one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our army; and the British are after
them!&#8221;</p>

<p>Washington, who stood by the side of his
great white horse, turned an angry face upon
the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, sir,&#8221; demanded he, &#8220;do you dare
bring us a false report at such a time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m telling the truth!&#8221; gasped the man,
his hands tossing in protest. &#8220;See, there;
he&#8217;ll tell you the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke he pointed to a small man in
an American uniform, who held a fife in his
hand, and had at that moment dashed breathlessly
up.</p>

<p>&#8220;All&#8217;s lost,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been driven
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>A swift command, and the fifer was in the
custody of Nat Brewster and Ezra Prentiss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him speak to any one,&#8221; was the
order. &#8220;He might spread a panic among the
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Washington mounted, and the officers
spurred forward. In a little while a scattering
of running men were met upon the road;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
then small bodies. Finally complete commands
were encountered. Some officers were
now ordered forward to find out the meaning
of the thing; dashing past Freehold Meeting
House, Washington came upon Grayson&#8217;s and
Patton&#8217;s regiments in full retreat and badly
disordered. Then came other commands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; demanded Washington of Colonel
Shreve, who rode at the head of his own regiment,
&#8220;is the entire advance party falling
back?&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Shreve smiled significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;General, I believe it is. And under the
orders of General Lee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; declared Major Howard of the same
command, &#8220;I never saw the like. It&#8217;s cowardice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are running from a shadow,&#8221; cried
another officer, hotly. &#8220;The most of us
never even caught sight of the enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though he had been close to Washington
since the opening of the war, Ben Cooper had
never seen him angry until now. As the
remainder of the advance now came up, the
commander-in-chief rode up to General Lee,
who came with it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>&#8220;General Lee, what is the meaning of
this?&#8221; cried Washington, his face white with
fury.</p>

<p>Lee flushed and seemed unable to answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you not speak?&#8221; demanded Washington.
&#8220;I desire to know the meaning of this
disorder and confusion!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lee&#8217;s naturally irascible nature here asserted
itself, and he made a stinging reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You asked for the command, sir,&#8221; said
Washington. &#8220;Why did you do so unless
you desired to fight the enemy?&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant it was upon Ben Cooper&#8217;s
tongue to ride forward and tell what he knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;But no, no,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;I
know but little, and am sure of nothing. I
had best be silent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though he was deeply exasperated at the
conduct of General Lee, Washington did not
lose sight of the fact that the enemy were
close upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are only fifteen minutes away,&#8221; reported
George Prentiss who, from a height,
had been observing them.</p>

<p>The place where Washington had stopped
the retreat, as it happened, was highly favorable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
for a stand. With eagle glance, Washington
saw this, and the command was posted
upon a hill, the only approach to which was
over a narrow causeway. To the left of this
eminence, Stewart and Ramsey&#8217;s batteries
were planted in a woody covert. Upon
another hill, there were two guns stationed
under Colonel Oswald. With all the hurry
and excitement of the moment, the different
bodies of troops moved with the precision of
machines.</p>

<p>When all was ready Washington once more
rode up to Lee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you retain this command, sir?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all one to me, sir, where I command,&#8221;
replied Lee.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall expect you to take proper measures
for checking the enemy,&#8221; said Washington.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your orders shall be obeyed,&#8221; returned
Lee. &#8220;I shall be the last to leave the
ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>The guns from the woods on the left and
from the hilltop had begun to speak, and the
British were brought to a halt. Washington
rode back and brought on the main body,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
which he formed upon a hill with thick woods
at its back and a swamp to the front. Sterling
had the left wing and Greene the right.</p>

<p>This time the command of Lee fought
stubbornly. Then, at last, he was obliged to
fall back, which he did in an orderly manner
upon the left.</p>

<p>Ben was with Greene&#8217;s division upon the
right, having been sent there with some orders.
From this position he saw the batteries of
General Sterling open upon the British and
force them back; there was a pause, then the
enemy came driving upon the position of
Greene. But here the artillery of Knox met
them with its thunder. In the face of it the
invaders came on; smoke was ascending in
choking clouds, but through it the red coats
and gleaming brass and steel of the British
could be seen. Their musket balls pattered
among the artillerymen like rain, and suddenly
Ben saw a stalwart sergeant throw up
his hands and fall. There was a shriek; a
figure with streaming red hair rushed to his
side and sank to her knees beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Sergeant Hayes that&#8217;s down,&#8221; reported
one of the men.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>&#8220;Take him to the rear,&#8221; was the order.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not badly hurt, Molly,&#8221; said Hayes to
his wife. &#8220;So don&#8217;t cry about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure?&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a scratch,&#8221; said the sergeant with
a smile as he was placed on a litter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another man, there, to Hayes&#8217; place,&#8221;
came the order.</p>

<p>As she stood watching the litter being borne
to the rear Molly Hayes heard these words.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; she cried, whirling about, &#8220;another
man to that gun!&#8221; pointing to the
piece at which her husband had fallen.
&#8220;Faith, then, there&#8217;s no need of it. That big-throated
roarer is one of the family, so it is,
and if one of us isn&#8217;t able to attend to it, the
other must.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that she seized a ramrod and
thrust it into the smoking maw of the cannon;
as brave as the bravest she worked away amid
the musket shot of the British, never heeding
them as they came plunging upon the battery.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a virago!&#8221; Ben heard a voice say
some little distance in his rear, and turning
swiftly in his saddle he recognized Tobias
Hawkins.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>&#8220;I wish there were more like her,&#8221; spoke
the officer to whom the remark had been
addressed. &#8220;And now, sir, let me again
request you to go to the rear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to have intruded,&#8221; said Tobias
Hawkins, as he turned his horse&#8217;s head. &#8220;The
fact is that I have a message of an important
and private nature for an officer whom I expected
to see here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the British fell back before the deadly
fire of Knox&#8217;s guns; and Ben Cooper as he
turned away had a last vision of Molly Hayes,
her mass of red hair tossing in the wind,
wildly cheering with the men; then the boy
rode after Tobias Hawkins.</p>

<p>As it chanced the man had taken a direction
across a stretch which had been only a short
time ago swept by the fire of General Wayne&#8217;s
command which lay concealed in an orchard
not far away. Before it was a command of
British being drawn up as though preparing
to make an attack. Ben glanced here and
there, but there was no sign of the Americans.</p>

<p>&#8220;They must have retreated,&#8221; thought the
boy.</p>

<p>Hearing the hoof-beats in his rear, Hawkins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
turned; and an evil smile overspread his face
at sight of Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once more,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it is you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; smiled Ben. &#8220;I saw you back
there by Knox&#8217;s battery, and heard what you
said regarding a private message for a friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Tobias Hawkins, &#8220;you did?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; nodded the boy, &#8220;and I rode after
you to say that if the friend is General Lee
you will find him somewhere on the left, as I
saw him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He had just gotten this far when Hawkins
drew a pistol and lifted it. But just then a
sheeted volley leaped from the orchard and
he sank to the ground. And as he did so,
Ben Cooper&#8217;s horse reared and plunged; the
lad fell from the saddle and lay like one dead,
while over him swept the charging division of
Monckton with leveled bayonets to dislodge
the command of General Wayne.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was well toward noon next day when
Ben Cooper was able to get upon his feet;
and then, surrounded by his anxious friends,
he made his way to the scene of yesterday&#8217;s
mishap.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>&#8220;Wayne must have been waiting for the
British,&#8221; said Ezra. &#8220;And as they charged
just as you got in line, you had to take your
chance. It&#8217;s lucky you weren&#8217;t killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben touched the bandage around his head
and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Wayne drive them back?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did. And before much else could be
done, darkness came on. We were all under
arms at daybreak; but the enemy had gone&mdash;ran
away in the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ran away!&#8221; Ben smiled once more.
&#8220;From now on he&#8217;ll be used to that. With the
armies and fleets of France to aid him, General
Washington will give him plenty of practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked the Porcupine, his
eyes upon a small group beside a gun.</p>

<p>There stood a cheering, laughing cluster of
young officers; then there was Molly Hayes
in the midst of them, standing at salute, while
before her was General Washington himself.
The boys approached through the lines of men
who, with litters, were bearing off the dead
from the field, and were just in time to hear
the commander-in-chief say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your bravery, Mistress Hayes, was equal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
to that of any man in the army. You served
your gun gallantly, and in the name of Congress
I thank you. My only regret is that I
can do nothing more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can, general, asthore,&#8221; cried a voice
from the rear, a voice which Ben at once recognized
as that of Paddy Burk. &#8220;Now that
her husband is wounded, make her a sergeant
in his place.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grave-faced commander-in-chief smiled
at the suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;An excellent notion; and from this time
on, Mistress Hayes, you are a sergeant in the
service of the United States, with the pay of
such and all the other things that such rank
demands.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a chorus of cheers at this, and
Molly Hayes, with cheeks stained crimson
and eyes shining, once more saluted with
proper military stiffness. And just then a
litter holding a body came up and Ben, as he
stepped aside to permit its passage, had a view
of the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;She earned it,&#8221; said Nat Brewster, who
had heard the story of Molly&#8217;s courage. &#8220;And
she&#8217;s deserved all she&#8217;s got.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>Ben turned away from the litter, and a
shudder ran through him. But, though he
closed his eyes, he could not shut out the cold,
white, dead face of Tobias Hawkins.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are more than she who have received
what they deserved,&#8221; said he, in a low
voice.</p>

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
